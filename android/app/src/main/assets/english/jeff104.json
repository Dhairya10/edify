Then I would, maybe, have a chance to come to Hollywood.\"*\n\n*– Anne Frank, 10 October 1942*\n\n# BEFORE YOU READ\n\n*Anneliese Marie 'Anne' Frank (12 June 1929 – February/March 1945) was a German – born Jewish girl who wrote while in hiding with her family and four friends in Amsterdam during the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II. Her family had moved to Amsterdam after the Nazis gained power in Germany but were trapped when the Nazi occupation extended into the Netherlands. As persecutions against the Jewish population increased, the family went into*\n\n*hiding in July 1942 in hidden rooms in her father Otto Frank's office building. After two years in hiding, the group was betrayed and transported to the concentration camp system where Anne died of typhus in Bergen-Belsen within days of her sister, Margot Frank. Her father, Otto, the only survivor of the group, returned to Amsterdam after the war ended, to find that her diary had been saved. Convinced that it was a unique record, he took action to have it published in English under the name* The Diary of a Young Girl*.*\n\n*The diary was given to Anne Frank for her thirteenth birthday and chronicles the events of her life from 12 June 1942 until its final entry of 1 August 1944. It was eventually translated from its original Dutch into many languages and became one of the world's most widely read books. There have also been several films, television and theatrical productions, and even an opera, based on the diary. Described as the work of a mature and insightful mind, the diary provides an intimate examination of daily life under Nazi occupation. Anne Frank has become one of the most renowned and discussed of the Holocaust victims.*\n\n# Activity\n\n*1. Do you keep a diary? Given below under 'A' are some terms we use to describe a written record of personal experience. Can you match them with their descriptions under 'B'? (You may look up the terms in a dictionary if you wish.)*\n\n| A                 | B                                                                                                |  |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|\n| (i)<br>Journal    | –<br>A book with a separate space or page for each<br>day, in which you write down your thoughts |  |\n| (ii)<br>Diary     | and feelings or what has happened on that day                                                    |  |\n| (iii)<br>Log      | –<br>A full record of a journey, a period of time, or<br>an event, written every day             |  |\n| (iv)<br>Memoir(s) | –<br>A record of a person's own life and experiences<br>(usually, a famous person)               |  |\n|                   | –<br>A written record of events with times and<br>dates, usually official                        |  |\n\n- *2. Here are some entries from personal records. Use the definitions above to decide which of the entries might be from a diary, a journal, a log or a memoir.*\n  - *(i) I woke up very late today and promptly got a scolding from Mum!

He was then looking for just someone like this for a small role in* Mera Naam Joker*, and he cast me on the spot. The rest, as they say, is history!*\n\n*Ans:*\n\nWRITING in a diary is a really strange experience for someone like me. Not only because I've never written anything before, but also because it seems to me that later on neither I nor anyone else will be interested in the musings of a thirteen-year-old schoolgirl. Oh well, it doesn't matter. I feel like writing, and I have an even greater need to get all kinds of things off my chest.\n\n'Paper has more patience than people.' I thought of this saying on one of those days when I was feeling a little depressed and was sitting at home with my chin in my hands, bored and listless, wondering whether to stay in or go out. I finally stayed where I was, brooding: Yes, paper *does* have more patience, and since I'm not planning to let anyone else read this stiff-backed notebook grandly referred to as a 'diary', unless I should ever find a real friend, it probably won't make a bit of difference.\n\nNow I'm back to the point that prompted me to keep a diary in the first place: I don't have a friend.\n\n50First Flight\n\nLet me put it more clearly, since no one will believe that a thirteen-year-old girl is completely alone in the world. And I'm not. I have loving parents and a sixteen-year-old sister, and there are about thirty people I can call friends. I have a family, loving aunts and a good home. No, on the surface I seem to have everything, except my one true friend. All I think about when I'm with friends is having a good time. I can't bring myself to talk about anything but ordinary everyday things. We don't seem to be able to get any closer, and that's the problem. Maybe it's my fault that we don't confide in each other. In any case, that's just how things are, and unfortunately they're not liable to change. This is why I've started the diary.\n\nTo enhance the image of this long-awaited friend in my imagination, I don't want to jot down the facts in this diary the way most people would do, but I want the diary to be my friend, and I'm going to call this friend 'Kitty'.\n\nlistless\n\nwith no energy or interest\n\n#### confide\n\nto tell personal things privately to a person that one trusts\n\n# Oral Comprehension Check\n\n- *1. What makes writing in a diary a strange experience for Anne Frank?*\n- *2. Why does Anne want to keep a diary?*\n- *3. Why did Anne think she could confide more in her diary than in people?*\n\nSince no one would understand a word of my stories to Kitty if I were to plunge right in, I'd better provide a brief sketch of my life, much as I dislike doing so.\n\nMy father, the most adorable father I've ever seen, didn't marry my mother until he was thirty-six and she was twenty-five. My sister, Margot, was born in Frankfurt in Germany in 1926. I was born on 12 June 1929. I lived in Frankfurt until I was four. My father emigrated to Holland in 1933. My mother, Edith Hollander Frank, went with him to Holland in September, while Margot and I were sent to Aachen to stay with our grandmother. Margot went to Holland in December, and I followed in February, when I was plunked down on the table as a birthday present for Margot.\n\nI started right away at the Montessori nursery school. I stayed there until I was six, at which time I started in the first form. In the sixth form my teacher was Mrs Kuperus, the headmistress. At the end of the year we were both in tears as we said a heartbreaking farewell.\n\nIn the summer of 1941 Grandma fell ill and had to have an operation, so my birthday passed with little celebration.\n\nGrandma died in January 1942. No one knows how often I think of her and still love her. This birthday celebration in 1942 was intended to make up for the other, and Grandma's candle was lit along with the rest.\n\nThe four of us are still doing well, and that brings me to the present date of 20 June 1942, and the solemn dedication of my diary.\n\n### Oral Comprehension Check\n\n- *1. Why does Anne provide a brief sketch of her life?*\n- *2. What tells you that Anne loved her grandmother?*\n\nplunked down (an informal word) put down in a casual way\n\nDearest Kitty,\n\nOur entire class is quaking in its boots. The reason, of course, is the forthcoming meeting in which the teachers decide who'll move up to the next form and who'll be kept back. Half the class is making bets. G.N. and I laugh ourselves silly at the two boys behind us, C.N. and Jacques, who have staked their entire holiday savings on their bet. From morning to night, it's \"You're going to pass\", \"No, I'm not\", \"Yes, you are\", \"No, I'm not\". Even G.'s pleading glances and my angry outbursts can't calm them down. If you ask me, there are so many dummies that about a quarter of the class should be kept back, but teachers are the most unpredictable creatures on earth.\n\nI'm not so worried about my girlfriends and myself. We'll make it. The only subject I'm not sure about is maths. Anyway, all we can do is wait. Until then, we keep telling each other not to lose heart.\n\nI get along pretty well with all my teachers. There are nine of them, seven men and two women. Mr Keesing, the old fogey who teaches maths, was annoyed with me for ages because I talked so much. After several warnings, he assigned me extra homework. An essay on the subject, 'A Chatterbox'. A chatterbox — what can you write about that? I'd worry about that later, I decided. I jotted down the title in my notebook, tucked it in my bag and tried to keep quiet.\n\nThat evening, after I'd finished the rest of my homework, the note about the essay caught my eye. I began thinking about the subject while chewing the tip of my fountain pen. Anyone could ramble on and leave big spaces between the words, but the trick was to come up with convincing arguments to prove the necessity of talking. I thought and thought, and suddenly I had an idea. I wrote the three pages Mr Keesing had assigned me and was satisfied. I argued that talking is a student's trait and that I would do my best to keep it under control,\n\nquaking in its boots shaking with fear and nervousness\n\nold fogey an old-fashioned person\n\nramble on talk or write aimlessly for long\n\n#### convincing argument\n\na statement made in such a manner that people believe it\n\nbut that I would never be able to cure myself of the habit since my mother talked as much as I did if not more, and that there's not much you can do about inherited traits.\n\nMr Keesing had a good laugh at my arguments, but when I proceeded to talk my way through the next lesson, he assigned me a second essay. This time it was supposed to be on 'An Incorrigible Chatterbox'. I handed it in, and Mr Keesing had nothing to complain about for two whole lessons. However, during the third lesson he'd finally had enough. \"Anne Frank, as punishment for talking in class, write an essay entitled — 'Quack, Quack, Quack, Said Mistress Chatterbox'.\"\n\n#### inherited traits\n\nqualities (physical or mental) that one gets from one's parents\n\n#### incorrigible\n\nsomething that cannot be corrected (usually a bad quality)\n\nThe class roared. I had to laugh too, though I'd nearly exhausted my ingenuity on the topic of chatterboxes. It was time to come up with something else, something original. My friend, Sanne, who's good at poetry, offered to help me write the essay from beginning to end in verse and I jumped for joy. Mr Keesing was trying to play a joke on me with this ridiculous subject, but I'd make sure the joke was on him.\n\nI finished my poem, and it was beautiful! It was about a mother duck and a father swan with three baby ducklings who were bitten to death by the father because they quacked too much. Luckily, Mr Keesing took the joke the right way. He read the ingenuity originality and inventiveness\n\npoem to the class, adding his own comments, and to several other classes as well. Since then I've been allowed to talk and haven't been assigned any extra homework. On the contrary, Mr Keesing's always making jokes these days.\n\nYours,\n\nAnne\n\n*[Extracted from* The Diary of a Young Girl*, with slight adaptation]*\n\n## Oral Comprehension Check\n\n- *1.

Phrasal Verbs\n\nA phrasal verb is a verb followed by a preposition or an adverb. Its meaning is often different from the meanings of its parts. Compare the meanings of the verbs *get on* and *run away* in (a) and (b) below. You can easily guess their meanings in (a) but in (b) they have special meanings.\n\n- (a) She *got on* at Agra when the bus stopped for breakfast.\n  - Dev Anand *ran away* from home when he was a teenager.\n- (b) She's eager to *get on* in life. (succeed)\n  - The visitors *ran away* with the match. (won easily)\n\nSome phrasal verbs have three parts: a verb followed by an adverb and a preposition.\n\n- (c) Our car *ran out of* petrol just outside the city limits.\n- (d) The government wants to *reach out to* the people with this new campaign.\n- 1. The text you've just read has a number of phrasal verbs commonly used in English. Look up the following in a dictionary for their meanings (under the entry for the italicised word).\n  - (i) *plunge* (right) in (iii) *ramble* on\n  - (ii) *kept* back (iv) *get* along with\n- 2. Now find the sentences in the lesson that have the phrasal verbs given below. Match them with their meanings. (You have already found out the meanings of some of them.) Are their meanings the same as that of their parts? (Note that two parts of a phrasal verb may occur separated in the text.)\n  - (i) plunge in speak or write without focus\n  - (ii) kept back stay indoors\n  - (iii) move up make (them) remain quiet\n  - (iv) ramble on have a good relationship with\n  - (v) get along with give an assignment (homework) to a person in authority (the teacher)\n  - (vi) calm down compensate\n  - (vii) stay in go straight to the topic\n  - (viii) make up for go to the next grade\n  - (ix) hand in not promoted\n\n### III. Idioms\n\n56First Flight\n\nIdioms are groups of words with a fixed order, and a particular meaning, different from the meanings of each of their words put together. (Phrasal verbs can also be idioms; they are said to be 'idiomatic' when their meaning is unpredictable.) For example, do you know what it means to 'meet one's match' in English? It means to meet someone who is as good as oneself, or even better, in some skill or quality. Do you know what it means to 'let the cat out of the bag'? Can you guess?\n\n### 1. Here are a few sentences from the text which have idiomatic expressions. Can you say what each means? (You might want to consult a dictionary first.)\n\n- (i) Our entire class is *quaking in its boots*.\n- (ii) Until then, we keep telling each other *not to lose heart*.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n- (iii) Mr Keesing was annoyed with me *for ages* because I talked so much.\n- (iv) Mr Keesing was trying to play a joke on me with this ridiculous subject, but I'd make sure *the joke was on him*.\n- 2. Here are a few more idiomatic expressions that occur in the text. Try to use them in sentences of your own.\n\n  - (i) caught my eye (iii) laugh ourselves silly\n- (ii) he'd had enough (iv) can't bring myself to\n- IV. Do you know how to use a dictionary to find out the meanings of idiomatic expressions? Take, for example, the expression *caught my eye* in the story*.* Where — under which word — would you look for it in the dictionary?\n\nLook for it under the first word. But if the first word is a 'grammatical' word like *a*, *the*, *for*, etc., then take the next word. That is, look for the first 'meaningful' word in the expression. In our example, it is the word *caught*.\n\nBut you won't find *caught* in the dictionary, because it is the past tense of *catch*. You'll find *caught* listed under *catch*. So you must look under *catch* for the expression *caught my eye*. Which other expressions with *catch* are listed in your dictionary?\n\nNote that a dictionary entry usually first gives the meanings of the word itself, and then gives a list of idiomatic expressions using that word. For example, study this partial entry for the noun 'eye' from the *Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary*, 2005.\n\n### Eye\n\n- Noun\n- Part of Body 1 [C] either of the two organs on the face that you see with: *The suspect has dark hair and green eyes.*\n- Ability to See 3 [sing.] the ability to see: *A surgeon needs a good eye and a steady hand*.\n- Way of Seeing 4 [C, usually sing.] a particular way of seeing sth: *He looked at the design with the eye of an engineer.*\n- Of Needle 5 [C] the hole in the end of a needle that you put the thread through.\n\nIDM *be all eyes* to be watching sb/sth carefully and with a lot of interest *before/in front of sb's (very) eyes* in sb's presence; in front of sb: *He had seen his life's work destroyed before his very eyes*. *Be up to your eyes in sth* to have a lot of sth to deal with: *We're up to our eyes in work.*\n\nYou have read the expression 'not to lose heart' in this text. Now find out the meanings of the following expressions using the word 'heart'.Use each of them in a sentence of your own.\n\n- 1. break somebody's heart\n- 2. close/dear to heart\n- 3. from the (bottom of your) heart\n- 4. have a heart\n- 5. have a heart of stone\n- 6. your heart goes out to somebody\n\n#### V. Contracted Forms\n\nWhen we speak, we use 'contracted forms' or short forms such as these:\n\ncan't (for *can not* or *cannot*) I'd (for *I would* or *I had*) she's (for *she is*)\n\nNotice that contracted forms are also written with an apostrophe to show a shortening of the spelling of *not*, *would*, or *is* as in the above example*.*\n\nWriting a diary is like speaking to oneself. Plays (and often, novels) also have speech in written form. So we usually come across contracted forms in diaries, plays and novels.\n\n1. Make a list of the contracted forms in the text. Rewrite them as full forms of two words.\n\nFor example:\n\nI've = I have\n\n2. We have seen that some contracted forms can stand for two different full forms:\n\nI'd = I had *or* I would\n\nFind in the text the contracted forms that stand for two different full forms, and say what these are.\n\n58First Flight\n\nHere is an extract adapted from a one-act play. In this extract, angry neighbours who think Joe the Inventor's new spinning machine will make them lose their jobs come to destroy Joe's model of the machine.\n\nYou've just seen how contracted forms can make a written text sound like actual speech. Try to make this extract sound more like a real conversation by changing some of the verbs back into contracted forms. Then speak out the lines.\n\n[*The door is flung open, and several men tramp in. They carry sticks, and one of them, HOB, has a hammer*.]\n\nMOB : Now where is your husband, mistress?\n\nMARY : In his bed. He is sick, and weary. You would not harm him!\n\n| HOB           | : | We are going to smash his evil work to pieces. Where is the<br>machine?                             |\n|---------------|---|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| SECOND<br>MAN | : | On the table yonder.                                                                                |\n| HOB           | : | Then here is the end of it!                                                                         |\n|               |   | [HOB smashes the model. MARY screams.]                                                              |\n| HOB           | : | And now for your husband!                                                                           |\n| MARY          | : | Neighbours, he is a sick man and almost a cripple. You would not<br>hurt him!                       |\n| HOB           | : | He is planning to take away our daily bread… We will show him<br>what we think of him and his ways! |\n| MARY          | : | You have broken his machine… You have done enough…                                                  |\n\nNow you know what a diary is and how to keep one. Can you keep a diary for a week recording the events that occur? You may share your diary with your class, if you wish to. Use the following hints to write your diary.\n\n- Though your diary is very private, write as if you are writing for someone else.\n- Present your thoughts in a convincing manner.\n- Use words that convey your feelings, and words that 'paint pictures' for the reader. Be brief.\n\n'Diary language' has some typical features such as subjectless sentences (Got up late in the morning), sentence fragments without subjects or verbs (…too bad, boring, not good), contracted forms (they're, I've, can't, didn't, etc.), and everyday expressions which people use in speech. Remember not to use such language in more formal kinds of writing.\n\nYour teacher will read out an extract from *The Diary of Samuel Pepys* (given on the next page) about the great fire of London.

She called at in the morning. Pepys went back to sleep because . Pepys rose again at in the morning. By then about houses had been burned down. The fire had spread to by London Bridge. Pepys then walked to the along with Sir J. Robinson's .\n\n### WHAT WE HAVE DONE\n\n- 1. Diary writing is one of the best ways to practise writing. Students do not have to think up or imagine what to write about; they only have to find words to write about what has happened. Initiate your students into the habit of keeping a diary.\n- 2. Anne Frank's diary became a public document after World War II. Discuss with your students diaries which became historical documents, such as Samuel Pepys's diary. You may draw students' attention to different types of diaries, e.g. private diary, general diary. Army officers, businessmen, doctors, executives, lawyers, motorists, police officers keep a general diary to record events that happen during the day and events that are scheduled for the day, such as appointments, meetings, things to be done, etc.\n- 3. Passage for listening exercise:\n\n### The Great Fire of London [1666]\n\nSeptember 2nd (Lord's Day). Jane called us up about three in the morning, to tell us of a great fire they saw in the city. So I rose and slipped on my nightgown, and went to her window, and thought it to be on the backside of Marke-Lane at the farthest; but being unused to such fire as followed, I thought it far enough off, and so went to bed again and to sleep.\n\nAbout seven rose again to dress myself, and then looked out of the window, and saw the fire not so much as it was and further off. By and by Jane comes and tells me that she hears that above 300 houses have been burned down tonight by the fire we saw, and that it is now burning down all Fish Street, by London Bridge.\n\nSo I made myself ready presently, and walked to the Tower, and there got up upon one of the high places, Sir J. Robinson's little son going up with me; and there I did see the houses at that end of the bridge all on fire, and an infinite great fire on this and the other side of the bridge.\n\n[From The Diary of Samuel Pepys ]\n\n### WHAT YOU CAN D<sup>O</sup>\n\nAfter they have completed the lesson, including the writing exercise, students can be asked to make a diary jotting for the previous day. Perhaps you could also write a diary entry describing what happened in school/class on the previous day, to share with the class — try and make it amusing and interesting! Collect students' pages (they may be allowed to sign their names or make it anonymous, as they wish) and put them up on the class notice board, together with your page, for everyone to read.\n\n# Amanda! Amanda!\n\n*Every child feels that she/he is controlled and instructed not to do one thing or another. You too may feel that your freedom is curtailed. Write down some of the things you want to do, but your parents/ elders do not allow you to. To read the poem aloud, form pairs, each reading alternate stanzas. You are in for a surprise!*\n\nDon't bite your nails, Amanda! Don't hunch your shoulders, Amanda! Stop that slouching and sit up straight, Amanda!\n\n(There is a languid, emerald sea, where the sole inhabitant is me a mermaid, drifting blissfully.)\n\nDid you finish your homework, Amanda? Did you tidy your room, Amanda? I thought I told you to clean your shoes, Amanda!\n\n(I am an orphan, roaming the street. I pattern soft dust with my hushed, bare feet. The silence is golden, the freedom is sweet.)\n\nDon't eat that chocolate, Amanda! Remember your acne, Amanda! Will you please look at me when I'm speaking to you, Amanda!\n\n(I am Rapunzel, I have not a care; life in a tower is tranquil and rare; I'll certainly *never* let down my bright hair!)\n\nStop that sulking at once, Amanda! You're always so moody, Amanda! Anyone would think that I nagged at you, Amanda!\n\n# ROBIN KLEIN\n\nlanguid: relaxed drifting: moving slowly pattern: make patterns tranquil: calm\n\n- 1.

        "question": "What makes writing in a diary a strange experience for Anne Frank?",
        "answer": "Writing in a diary is strange for Anne because she has never written anything before, and she doubts that anyone (including herself) would be interested in the thoughts of a thirteen-year-old schoolgirl. She finds it unusual to write personal thoughts knowing that no one else will likely read them."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does Anne want to keep a diary?",
        "answer": "Anne wants to keep a diary because she feels the need to get things off her chest and express her thoughts. She believes 'paper has more patience than people' and wants the diary to serve as the true friend she lacks. She feels alone despite having family and acquaintances, and sees the diary as someone she can truly confide in."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why did Anne think she could confide more in her diary than in people?",
        "answer": "Anne felt she could confide more in her diary because paper has more patience than people. She couldn't bring herself to talk about anything deeper than ordinary everyday things with her friends and family. The diary wouldn't judge her and would always be available to listen to her thoughts and feelings without interruption or criticism."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does Anne provide a brief sketch about her family?",
        "answer": "Anne provides a brief sketch of her family because she realizes that no one would understand her stories to Kitty without background context. She treats Kitty as an outsider who needs to be introduced to her life circumstances, family members, and personal history to better understand her future diary entries."
      },
      {
        "question": "What tells you that Anne loved her grandmother?",
        "answer": "Anne's love for her grandmother is evident when she writes 'No one knows how often I think of her and still love her' after mentioning her grandmother's death in January 1942. Additionally, she mentions that her grandmother's candle was lit along with others during her 1942 birthday celebration, showing she wanted to honor and remember her grandmother on special occasions."

      {
        "question": "Why was Mr Keesing annoyed with Anne? What did he ask her to do?",
        "answer": "Mr Keesing was annoyed with Anne because she talked too much in class. After several warnings, he assigned her extra homework in the form of essays. First, he asked her to write an essay on 'A Chatterbox,' then 'An Incorrigible Chatterbox,' and finally 'Quack, Quack, Quack, Said Mistress Chatterbox' as punishments for her excessive talking."
      },
      {
        "question": "How did Anne justify her being a chatterbox in her essay?",
        "answer": "Anne justified being a chatterbox by arguing that talking is a student's natural trait and that while she would try to control it, she could never completely cure herself of the habit. She explained that her mother talked as much as she did (if not more), and that inherited traits cannot be easily changed. This made it seem like a family characteristic rather than a personal flaw."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you think Mr Keesing was a strict teacher?",
        "answer": "Mr Keesing appears to be firm but fair rather than overly strict. While he gave Anne punishments for talking, he had a good sense of humor and could appreciate her clever responses. He laughed at her arguments, shared her poem with other classes, and eventually allowed her to talk without further punishment. His approach shows he was trying to teach discipline while maintaining a good relationship with his student."
      },
      {
        "question": "What made Mr Keesing allow Anne to talk in class?",
        "answer": "Mr Keesing allowed Anne to talk in class after she wrote a humorous poem for her third essay assignment. The poem was about a mother duck and father swan whose three baby ducklings were bitten to death by the father for quacking too much. Mr Keesing appreciated the cleverness and humor of her response, took the joke well, and decided to stop giving her extra assignments. Her creativity and wit won him over."
      },
      {
        "question": "Was Anne right when she said that the world would not be interested in the musings of a thirteen-year-old girl?",
        "answer": "Anne was completely wrong in this assessment. Her diary became one of the world's most widely read books, translated into many languages, and adapted into films, television shows, theatrical productions, and even an opera. Her musings provided an invaluable, intimate examination of life during Nazi occupation and made her one of the most renowned Holocaust victims. Her thoughts and experiences resonated with millions of readers worldwide."
      },
      {
        "question": "Compare Anne's diary with the examples in 'Before You Read' section. In what way is Anne's diary different?",
        "answer": "Anne's diary is much more personal, reflective, and literary compared to the simple factual entries in the examples. While the sample entries are brief, factual records of events, Anne's diary reads like thoughtful letters to a friend. She originally wrote in Dutch, and her entries are longer, more philosophical, and emotionally rich. She treats her diary as a confidant named 'Kitty' rather than just a record book, making it more like a conversation than a log of events."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does Anne feel about her father, grandmother, Mrs Kuperus and Mr Keesing? What do these tell you about her?",
        "answer": "Anne describes her father as 'the most adorable father I've ever seen,' showing deep love and admiration. She thinks of her grandmother often and 'still loves her,' indicating lasting affection. She mentions being in tears when saying farewell to Mrs Kuperus, showing she forms strong emotional bonds. With Mr Keesing, she shows respect despite their conflicts. These relationships reveal Anne as someone who forms deep, meaningful connections with people and values emotional bonds highly."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does Anne write in her first essay?",
        "answer": "In her first essay on 'A Chatterbox,' Anne argues that talking is a natural student trait and that while she would try to control her talking, she could never completely cure herself of the habit. She explains that her mother talks as much as she does (if not more) and that inherited traits cannot be easily changed. She presents this as a logical argument to justify her talkative nature."
      },
      {
        "question": "Anne says teachers are most unpredictable. Is Mr Keesing unpredictable? How?",
        "answer": "Yes, Mr Keesing is unpredictable in a positive way. While Anne expected him to be consistently strict about her talking, he showed unexpected humor and flexibility. He laughed at her arguments, appreciated her creative responses, shared her poem with multiple classes, and eventually stopped punishing her. His ability to see the humor in the situation and change his approach based on her clever responses demonstrates his unpredictable, human side."

        "question": "What do the given statements tell you about Anne Frank as a person? (Various quotes about her relationships, diary approach, humor, and observations)",
        "answer": "These statements reveal Anne as: (i) Self-reflective and willing to take responsibility for relationship problems; (ii) Creative and wanting her diary to be special and meaningful rather than just factual; (iii) Humorous and able to find lightness even in describing serious situations; (iv) Observant and critical, with strong opinions about her classmates and teachers; (v) Intelligent and strategic, understanding that good arguments require substance rather than just filling space. Overall, they show her as a thoughtful, creative, and mature young person with strong emotional intelligence."

These expressions use figurative language to convey meanings beyond their literal words."

        "question": "Use idiomatic expressions in sentences: caught my eye, he'd had enough, laugh ourselves silly, can't bring myself to",
        "answer": "Sample sentences: (i) 'The bright red dress caught my eye in the shop window'; (ii) 'After three hours of loud music, he'd had enough and left the party'; (iii) 'We laugh ourselves silly watching comedy shows together'; (iv) 'I can't bring myself to throw away my childhood toys.'

        "answer": "Examples include: I'd = I had or I would; we'd = we had or we would; you'd = you had or you would; he'd = he had or he would; she'd = she had or she would.

        "answer": "Based on the listening passage: This entry was made on September 2nd by Samuel Pepys. The person who told Pepys about the fire was called Jane. She called at about three in the morning. Pepys went back to sleep because he thought the fire was far enough off. Pepys rose again at seven in the morning. By then about 300 houses had been burned down. The fire had spread to Fish Street by London Bridge. Pepys then walked to the Tower along with Sir J. Robinson's little son."

        "question": "How old do you think Amanda is? How do you know this?",
        "answer": "Amanda appears to be a young teenager, likely around 12-14 years old. This can be inferred from the type of instructions she receives (don't bite nails, do homework, clean room), the mention of acne (common in adolescence), and her moody, sulking behavior which is typical of teenagers asserting independence. The parental concerns about posture, homework, and appearance are characteristic of this age group."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who do you think is speaking to her?",
        "answer": "The speaker is most likely Amanda's mother or a parent/guardian. The tone is authoritative and concerned with typical parental issues like homework, cleanliness, posture, health (acne), and behavior. The familiarity and constant monitoring of Amanda's activities suggests a close family relationship, most probably a mother who is trying to guide and correct her daughter's behavior."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why are Stanzas 2, 4 and 6 given in parenthesis?",
        "answer": "The stanzas in parentheses represent Amanda's internal thoughts and daydreams. They show her mental escape from the constant instructions and nagging she receives. The parentheses indicate these are private, unspoken thoughts happening in her mind while the external voice continues to give instructions. This literary device creates a contrast between external pressure and internal freedom."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is the speaker in Stanzas 2, 4 and 6? Do you think this speaker is listening to the speaker in Stanzas 1, 3, 5, and 7?",
        "answer": "The speaker in stanzas 2, 4, and 6 is Amanda herself, expressing her inner thoughts and fantasies. No, this speaker (Amanda in her mind) is not really listening to the external speaker (her mother/parent). Instead, she is mentally escaping into fantasy worlds where she has freedom and peace, showing how she copes with constant criticism by retreating into her imagination."
      },
      {
        "question": "What could Amanda do if she were a mermaid?",
        "answer": "If Amanda were a mermaid, she could drift blissfully in a languid, emerald sea where she would be the sole inhabitant. This represents her desire for solitude, peace, and freedom from constant supervision and criticism. As a mermaid, she would have complete autonomy over her environment and wouldn't have to deal with rules, instructions, or other people's expectations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Amanda an orphan? Why does she say so?",
        "answer": "No, Amanda is not actually an orphan - she clearly has at least one parent who is constantly instructing her. She fantasizes about being an orphan because orphans, in her imagination, have freedom to roam the streets without parental supervision. She romanticizes the idea of independence and the 'golden silence' and 'sweet freedom' that she believes would come with not having parents to constantly correct and guide her."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you know the story of Rapunzel? Why does she want to be Rapunzel?",
        "answer": "Rapunzel was a fairy tale character locked in a tower who let down her long hair for her prince to climb up. Amanda wants to be Rapunzel because she sees the tower as a place of tranquil solitude, away from nagging and instructions. Ironically, she says she'll 'never let down her bright hair,' meaning she doesn't want to be rescued - she wants to stay in the peaceful isolation of the tower, away from the outside world's demands and expectations."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does the girl yearn for? What does this poem tell you about Amanda?",
        "answer": "Amanda yearns for freedom, solitude, peace, and independence from constant supervision and criticism. She wants to be left alone without being told what to do constantly. The poem reveals that Amanda is a creative, imaginative child who feels overwhelmed by parental expectations and criticism. She copes by retreating into fantasy worlds where she has control and peace. The poem shows the conflict between a parent's well-meaning guidance and a child's need for autonomy and acceptance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Read the last stanza. Do you think Amanda is sulking and is moody?",
        "answer": "While Amanda may appear to be sulking and moody on the surface, the poem suggests this behavior is a natural response to constant criticism and instruction. The final line 'Anyone would think that I nagged at you, Amanda!' shows the parent's lack of self-awareness about their own behavior. Amanda's moodiness is likely a defense mechanism against feeling constantly criticized and controlled. The poem suggests that the parent's approach may be contributing to Amanda's withdrawn behavior rather than helping her."

The chapter also includes extensive language work on compound words, phrasal verbs, idioms, and contracted forms commonly found in informal writing. Additionally, it features the poem 'Amanda!' which depicts a young girl's desire for freedom from constant parental instructions and her escape into fantasy worlds. Both texts highlight young people's need for self-expression and autonomy, whether through writing or imagination, while dealing with adult authority and expectations."
