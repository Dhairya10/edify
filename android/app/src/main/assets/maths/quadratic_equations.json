You have seen that such equations have degree one. In this chapter, we shall study about quadratic equations, and their solutions. The general form of a quadratic equation is ax² + bx + c = 0, where a, b, c are real numbers and a ≠ 0.</p><p>Quadratic equations appear in many real-life situations such as calculating areas, profit and loss problems, problems related to speed, and many other mathematical applications.</p><h2>4.2 Quadratic Equations</h2><p>A quadratic equation in variable x is an equation of the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a, b, c are real numbers with a ≠ 0.</p><p>Here:</p><p>• a is called the coefficient of x²<br>• b is called the coefficient of x<br>• c is called the constant term</p><p><strong>Examples of quadratic equations:</strong></p><p>1. 2x² + 3x + 1 = 0 (Here a = 2, b = 3, c = 1)<br>2. x² - 5x + 6 = 0 (Here a = 1, b = -5, c = 6)<br>3. 3x² - 7 = 0 (Here a = 3, b = 0, c = -7)<br>4. x² + 4x = 0 (Here a = 1, b = 4, c = 0)</p><h3>4.2.1 Roots of a Quadratic Equation</h3><p>The values of the variable x which satisfy the quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0 are called the roots or zeros of the quadratic equation.</p><p>For example, x = 2 and x = 3 are the roots of the equation x² - 5x + 6 = 0 because:</p><p>When x = 2: (2)² - 5(2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0<br>When x = 3: (3)² - 5(3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0</p><h2>4.3 Solution of a Quadratic Equation by Factorisation</h2><p>If we can factorise ax² + bx + c, a ≠ 0, into a product of two linear factors, then the roots of the quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0 can be found by equating each factor to zero.</p><h3>Example 1:</h3><p>Solve: x² + 5x + 6 = 0</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>We need to factorise x² + 5x + 6<br>We look for two numbers whose product is 6 and sum is 5<br>These numbers are 2 and 3<br>So, x² + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)<br>Therefore, (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0<br>This gives us: x + 2 = 0 or x + 3 = 0<br>Hence, x = -2 or x = -3</p><h3>Example 2:</h3><p>Solve: 2x² - 7x + 3 = 0</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>We factorise 2x² - 7x + 3<br>2x² - 7x + 3 = 2x² - 6x - x + 3<br>= 2x(x - 3) - 1(x - 3)<br>= (2x - 1)(x - 3)<br>Therefore, (2x - 1)(x - 3) = 0<br>This gives us: 2x - 1 = 0 or x - 3 = 0<br>Hence, x = 1/2 or x = 3</p><h2>4.4 Solution of a Quadratic Equation by Completing the Square</h2><p>Sometimes, it may not be easy to factorise the quadratic expression ax² + bx + c. In such cases, we use the method of completing the square.</p><p>Consider the quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0, a ≠ 0</p><p>Dividing throughout by a: x² + (b/a)x + c/a = 0<br>Rearranging: x² + (b/a)x = -c/a<br>Adding (b/2a)² to both sides:<br>x² + (b/a)x + (b/2a)² = -c/a + (b/2a)²<br>(x + b/2a)² = (b² - 4ac)/4a²<br>Taking square root: x + b/2a = ±√(b² - 4ac)/2a<br>Therefore: x = -b/2a ± √(b² - 4ac)/2a<br>x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac))/2a</p><h2>4.5 Quadratic Formula</h2><p>For any quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0, where a ≠ 0, the roots are given by:</p><p><strong>x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac))/2a</strong></p><p>This is called the quadratic formula.</p><h3>Example 3:</h3><p>Solve: 3x² + 2x - 1 = 0 using quadratic formula</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>Here, a = 3, b = 2, c = -1<br>Using quadratic formula:<br>x = (-2 ± √(2² - 4(3)(-1)))/2(3)<br>x = (-2 ± √(4 + 12))/6<br>x = (-2 ± √16)/6<br>x = (-2 ± 4)/6<br>Therefore, x = (-2 + 4)/6 = 2/6 = 1/3 or x = (-2 - 4)/6 = -6/6 = -1</p><h2>4.6 Nature of Roots</h2><p>The expression b² - 4ac is called the discriminant of the quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0.</p><p>The discriminant determines the nature of roots:</p><p>• If b² - 4ac > 0, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots<br>• If b² - 4ac = 0, the quadratic equation has two equal real roots<br>• If b² - 4ac < 0, the quadratic equation has no real roots</p><h3>Example 4:</h3><p>Find the nature of roots of 2x² - 6x + 3 = 0</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>Here, a = 2, b = -6, c = 3<br>Discriminant = b² - 4ac = (-6)² - 4(2)(3) = 36 - 24 = 12<br>Since discriminant > 0, the equation has two distinct real roots.</p><h2>4.7 Relationship between Roots and Coefficients</h2><p>If α and β are the roots of the quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0, then:</p><p>• Sum of roots: α + β = -b/a<br>• Product of roots: αβ = c/a</p><p>These relationships are very useful in solving problems without actually finding the roots.</p><h3>Example 5:</h3><p>If the roots of x² - 7x + k = 0 are α and β such that α - β = 1, find the value of k.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>Given: α + β = 7 and α - β = 1<br>Adding these equations: 2α = 8, so α = 4<br>Subtracting: 2β = 6, so β = 3<br>Product of roots: αβ = k<br>Therefore, k = 4 × 3 = 12</p>",

            "summary": "<p>This chapter introduces quadratic equations, which are polynomial equations of degree 2 in the standard form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a ≠ 0. Students learn three main methods to solve these equations: factorisation (splitting the middle term), completing the square, and using the quadratic formula x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac))/2a. The chapter also covers the concept of discriminant (b² - 4ac) which determines whether the equation has two distinct real roots, two equal real roots, or no real roots.</p><p>Additionally, the chapter explores the relationship between roots and coefficients, showing that for roots α and β, the sum α + β = -b/a and product αβ = c/a. These concepts are applied to solve real-life problems involving areas, motion, and other practical situations. The chapter builds a strong foundation for understanding quadratic relationships and prepares students for more advanced algebraic concepts in higher classes.</p>"
