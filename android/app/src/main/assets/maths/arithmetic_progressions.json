For example, roll numbers of students in a class, days in a week, months in a year, etc. In mathematics, we often come across sequences where terms follow a specific pattern. One such sequence is called an Arithmetic Progression (A.P.).</p><p>Consider the following sequences:</p><p>• 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...</p><p>• 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...</p><p>• 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, ...</p><p>In each of these sequences, each term (except the first) differs from the preceding term by a fixed number. Such sequences are called arithmetic progressions.</p><h2>5.2 Definition of Arithmetic Progression</h2><p>An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers in which each term after the first is obtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding term.</p><p>The fixed number is called the <strong>common difference</strong> and is usually denoted by 'd'.</p><p>If 'a' is the first term of an A.P. and 'd' is the common difference, then the A.P. can be written as:</p><p>a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, a+4d, ...</p><h3>Examples:</h3><p><strong>Example 1:</strong> In the sequence 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, ...<br>First term (a) = 3<br>Common difference (d) = 7 - 3 = 4<br>Each term is obtained by adding 4 to the previous term.</p><p><strong>Example 2:</strong> In the sequence 20, 15, 10, 5, 0, ...<br>First term (a) = 20<br>Common difference (d) = 15 - 20 = -5<br>Each term is obtained by adding -5 to the previous term.</p><h2>5.3 General Term of an Arithmetic Progression</h2><p>Let us consider an A.P. with first term 'a' and common difference 'd':</p><p>First term = a₁ = a</p><p>Second term = a₂ = a + d</p><p>Third term = a₃ = a + 2d</p><p>Fourth term = a₄ = a + 3d</p><p>...</p><p>nth term = aₙ = a + (n-1)d</p><p>Therefore, the <strong>nth term of an A.P.</strong> is given by:</p><p><strong>aₙ = a + (n-1)d</strong></p><p>where:<br>• aₙ is the nth term<br>• a is the first term<br>• d is the common difference<br>• n is the number of terms</p><h3>Solved Examples:</h3><p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Find the 10th term of the A.P. 5, 8, 11, 14, ...</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>Here, a = 5, d = 8 - 5 = 3, n = 10<br>Using the formula: aₙ = a + (n-1)d<br>a₁₀ = 5 + (10-1) × 3<br>a₁₀ = 5 + 9 × 3<br>a₁₀ = 5 + 27 = 32</p><p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Which term of the A.P. 21, 18, 15, ... is -81?</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>Here, a = 21, d = 18 - 21 = -3<br>Let the nth term be -81<br>Using aₙ = a + (n-1)d<br>-81 = 21 + (n-1)(-3)<br>-81 = 21 - 3(n-1)<br>-81 - 21 = -3(n-1)<br>-102 = -3(n-1)<br>34 = n-1<br>n = 35</p><p>Therefore, the 35th term is -81.</p><h2>5.4 Sum of First n Terms of an A.P.</h2><p>The sum of the first n terms of an A.P. is denoted by Sₙ.</p><p>Let us consider an A.P.: a, a+d, a+2d, ..., a+(n-1)d</p><p>Sum = Sₙ = a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + ... + (a+(n-1)d) ... (1)</p><p>Writing the terms in reverse order:</p><p>Sₙ = (a+(n-1)d) + (a+(n-2)d) + ... + (a+d) + a ... (2)</p><p>Adding equations (1) and (2):</p><p>2Sₙ = [a + (a+(n-1)d)] + [(a+d) + (a+(n-2)d)] + ... + [(a+(n-1)d) + a]</p><p>2Sₙ = [2a + (n-1)d] + [2a + (n-1)d] + ... + [2a + (n-1)d]</p><p>2Sₙ = n[2a + (n-1)d]</p><p>Therefore, <strong>Sₙ = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d]</strong></p><p>Alternative formula: If the last term is 'l', then:</p><p><strong>Sₙ = n/2 (a + l)</strong></p><p>where l = a + (n-1)d</p><h3>Solved Examples:</h3><p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Find the sum of first 20 terms of the A.P. 6, 10, 14, 18, ...</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>Here, a = 6, d = 10 - 6 = 4, n = 20<br>Using Sₙ = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d]<br>S₂₀ = 20/2 [2(6) + (20-1)(4)]<br>S₂₀ = 10 [12 + 19 × 4]<br>S₂₀ = 10 [12 + 76]<br>S₂₀ = 10 × 88 = 880</p><p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Find the sum of first 15 terms of the A.P. 5, 2, -1, -4, ...</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>Here, a = 5, d = 2 - 5 = -3, n = 15<br>Using Sₙ = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d]<br>S₁₅ = 15/2 [2(5) + (15-1)(-3)]<br>S₁₅ = 15/2 [10 + 14 × (-3)]<br>S₁₅ = 15/2 [10 - 42]<br>S₁₅ = 15/2 × (-32) = 15 × (-16) = -240</p><h2>5.5 Properties of Arithmetic Progression</h2><p><strong>Property 1:</strong> If a constant is added to each term of an A.P., the resulting sequence is also an A.P. with the same common difference.</p><p><strong>Property 2:</strong> If a constant is subtracted from each term of an A.P., the resulting sequence is also an A.P. with the same common difference.</p><p><strong>Property 3:</strong> If each term of an A.P. is multiplied by a non-zero constant, the resulting sequence is also an A.P.</p><p><strong>Property 4:</strong> Three numbers a, b, c are in A.P. if and only if 2b = a + c. Here, 'b' is called the arithmetic mean of 'a' and 'c'.</p><h2>5.6 Arithmetic Mean</h2><p>If three numbers a, b, c are in A.P., then b is called the arithmetic mean of a and c.</p><p>From the property of A.P.: b - a = c - b</p><p>This gives us: 2b = a + c</p><p>Therefore: <strong>b = (a + c)/2</strong></p><p>The arithmetic mean of n numbers a₁, a₂, a₃, ..., aₙ is:</p><p><strong>A.M. = (a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + ... + aₙ)/n</strong></p><h3>Example:</h3><p><strong>Find the arithmetic mean of 8, 12, 16, 20, 24.</strong></p><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>A.M. = (8 + 12 + 16 + 20 + 24)/5 = 80/5 = 16</p><h2>5.7 Applications of Arithmetic Progressions</h2><p>Arithmetic progressions have many real-life applications:</p><p>• <strong>Finance:</strong> Simple interest calculations, installment payments</p><p>• <strong>Construction:</strong> Steps of a staircase, seating arrangements</p><p>• <strong>Time and Distance:</strong> Uniform motion problems</p><p>• <strong>Temperature:</strong> Regular temperature changes</p><h3>Example Application:</h3><p><strong>A man saves ₹200 in the first month, ₹250 in the second month, ₹300 in the third month, and so on.
