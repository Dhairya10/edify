Recall that if *p*(*x*) is a polynomial in *x*, the highest power of *x* in *p*(*x*) is called **the degree of the polynomial** *p*(*x*). For example, 4*x* + 2 is a polynomial in the variable *x* of degree 1, 2*y*<sup>2</sup> – 3*y* + 4 is a polynomial in the variable *y* of degree 2, 5*x*<sup>3</sup> – 4*x*<sup>2</sup> + *x* – 2\n\nis a polynomial in the variable *x* of degree 3 and 7*u*<sup>6</sup> – <sup>3</sup> 4 2 4 8 2 *u uu* is a polynomial\n\nin the variable *u* of degree 6. Expressions like <sup>1</sup> *x* 1 , *x* 2 , 2 1 *x x* 2 3 etc., are not polynomials.\n\nA polynomial of degree 1 is called a **linear polynomial**. For example, 2*x* – 3, 3 5, *<sup>x</sup> <sup>y</sup>* <sup>2</sup> , <sup>2</sup> 11 *x* , 3*z* + 4, <sup>2</sup> <sup>1</sup> 3 *u* , etc., are all linear polynomials. Polynomials such as 2*x* + 5 – *x*<sup>2</sup> , *x*<sup>3</sup> + 1, etc., are not linear polynomials.\n\nA polynomial of degree 2 is called a **quadratic polynomial**. The name 'quadratic' has been derived from the word 'quadrate', which means 'square'. <sup>2</sup> <sup>2</sup> 2 3 , 5 *x x*\n\n$$\ny^2 - 2\n$$\n,  $2 - x^2 + \\sqrt{3}x$ ,  $\\frac{u}{3} - 2u^2 + 5$ ,  $\\sqrt{5}v^2 - \\frac{2}{3}v$ ,  $4z^2 + \\frac{1}{7}$  are some examples of\n\nquadratic polynomials (whose coefficients are real numbers). More generally, any quadratic polynomial in *x* is of the form *ax*<sup>2</sup>  *+ bx* + *c*, where *a*, *b*, *c* are real numbers and *a* 0. A polynomial of degree 3 is called a **cubic polynomial**. Some examples of\n\na cubic polynomial are 2 – *x*<sup>3</sup> , *x*<sup>3</sup> , 3 2 , *x* 3 – *x*<sup>2</sup> + *x*<sup>3</sup> , 3*x*3 – 2*x*<sup>2</sup> + *x* – 1. In fact, the most general form of a cubic polynomial is\n\n$$\nax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d,\n$$\n\nwhere, *a*, *b*, *c*, *d* are real numbers and *a* 0.\n\nNow consider the polynomial *p*(*x*) = *x*<sup>2</sup> – 3*x* – 4. Then, putting *x* = 2 in the polynomial, we get *p*(2) = 22 – 3 × 2 – 4 = – 6. The value '– 6', obtained by replacing *x* by 2 in *x*<sup>2</sup> – 3*x* – 4, is the value of *x*<sup>2</sup> – 3*x* – 4 at *x* = 2. Similarly, *p*(0) is the value of *p*(*x*) at *x* = 0, which is – 4.\n\nIf *p*(*x*) is a polynomial in *x*, and if *k* is any real number, then the value obtained by replacing *x* by *k* in *p*(*x*), is called **the value of** *p***(***x***) at** *x* **=** *k*, and is denoted by *p*(*k*).\n\nWhat is the value of *p*(*x*) = *x*<sup>2</sup> –3*x* – 4 at *x* = –1? We have :\n\n$$\np(-1) = (-1)^2 - \\{3 \\times (-1)\\} - 4 = 0\n$$\n\nAlso, note that *p*(4) = 42 – (3 4) – 4 = 0.\n\nAs *p*(–1) = 0 and *p*(4) = 0, –1 and 4 are called the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial *x*<sup>2</sup> – 3*x* – 4. More generally, a real number *k* is said to be a **zero of a polynomial** *p***(***x***)**, if *p*(*k*) = 0.\n\nYou have already studied in Class IX, how to find the zeroes of a linear polynomial. For example, if *k* is a zero of *p*(*x*) = 2*x* + 3, then *p*(*k*) = 0 gives us <sup>2</sup>*k* + 3 = 0, i.e., *k* = <sup>3</sup>\n\n2 In general, if *k* is a zero of *p*(*x*) = *ax* + *b*, then *p*(*k*) = *ak* + *b* = 0, i.e., *<sup>b</sup> <sup>k</sup> a* So, the zero of the linear polynomial *ax* + *b* is (Constant term) Coefficient of *b a x* .\n\nThus, the zero of a linear polynomial is related to its coefficients. Does this happen in the case of other polynomials too? For example, are the zeroes of a quadratic polynomial also related to its coefficients?\n\nIn this chapter, we will try to answer these questions. We will also study the division algorithm for polynomials.\n\n#### **2.2 Geometrical Meaning of the Zeroes of a Polynomial**\n\nYou know that a real number *k* is a zero of the polynomial *p*(*x*) if *p*(*k*) = 0. But why are the zeroes of a polynomial so important? To answer this, first we will see the **geometrical** representations of linear and quadratic polynomials and the geometrical meaning of their zeroes.\n\nConsider first a linear polynomial *ax* + *b*, *a* 0. You have studied in Class IX that the graph of *y* = *ax* + *b* is a straight line. For example, the graph of *y* = 2*x* + 3 is a straight line passing through the points (– 2, –1) and (2, 7).\n\n| x          | –2 | 2 |\n|------------|----|---|\n| y = 2x + 3 | –1 | 7 |\n\nFrom Fig. 2.1, you can see that the graph of *y* = 2*x* + 3 intersects the *x* -axis mid-way between *x* = –1 and *x* = – 2, that is, at the point <sup>3</sup> , <sup>0</sup> 2 . You also know that the zero of <sup>2</sup>*x* + 3 is <sup>3</sup> <sup>2</sup> . Thus, the zero of the polynomial 2*x* + 3 is the *x*-coordinate of the point where the graph of *y* = 2*x* + 3 intersects the *x*-axis.\n\n![](_page_2_Figure_4.jpeg)\n\n**Fig. 2.1**\n\nIn general, for a linear polynomial *ax* + *b*, *a* 0, the graph of *y* = *ax* + *b* is a straight line which intersects the *x*-axis at exactly one point, namely, , <sup>0</sup> *<sup>b</sup> a* . Therefore, the linear polynomial *ax* + *b*, *a* 0, has exactly one zero, namely, the *x*-coordinate of the point where the graph of *y* = *ax* + *b* intersects the *x*-axis.\n\nNow, let us look for the geometrical meaning of a zero of a quadratic polynomial. Consider the quadratic polynomial *x*<sup>2</sup> – 3*x* – 4. Let us see what the graph\\* of *y* = *x*<sup>2</sup> – 3*x* – 4 looks like. Let us list a few values of *y* = *x*<sup>2</sup> – 3*x* – 4 corresponding to a few values for *x* as given in Table 2.1.\n\n<sup>\\*</sup> Plotting of graphs of quadratic or cubic polynomials is not meant to be done by the students, nor is to be evaluated.\n\n**Table 2.1**\n\n| x                  | – 2 | –1 | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4 | 5 |\n|--------------------|-----|----|-----|-----|-----|-----|---|---|\n| y = x2<br>– 3x – 4 | 6   | 0  | – 4 | – 6 | – 6 | – 4 | 0 | 6 |\n\nIf we locate the points listed above on a graph paper and draw the graph, it will actually look like the one given in Fig. 2.2.\n\nIn fact, for any quadratic polynomial *ax*<sup>2</sup> + *bx* + *c*, *a* 0, the graph of the corresponding equation *y* = *ax*<sup>2</sup> + *bx* + *c* has one of the two shapes either open upwards like or open downwards like depending on whether *a* > 0 or *a* < 0. (These curves are called **parabolas**.)\n\nYou can see from Table 2.1 that –1 and 4 are zeroes of the quadratic polynomial. Also note from Fig. 2.2 that –1 and 4 are the *x*-coordinates of the points where the graph of *y* = *x*<sup>2</sup> – 3*x* – 4 intersects the *x*-axis. Thus, the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial *x*2 – 3*x* – 4 are *x*-coordinates of the points where the graph of *y* = *x*<sup>2</sup> – 3*x* – 4 intersects the *x*-axis.\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_7.jpeg)\n\n**Fig. 2.2**\n\nThis fact is true for any quadratic polynomial, i.e., the zeroes of a quadratic polynomial *ax*<sup>2</sup> + *bx* + *c*, *a* 0, are precisely the *x*-coordinates of the points where the parabola representing *y* = *ax*<sup>2</sup> + *bx* + *c* intersects the *x*-axis.\n\nFrom our observation earlier about the shape of the graph of *y* = *ax*<sup>2</sup> + *bx* + *c*, the following three cases can happen:\n\n**Case (i) :** Here, the graph cuts *x*-axis at two distinct points A and A.\n\nThe *x*-coordinates of A and A are the **two zeroes** of the quadratic polynomial *ax*<sup>2</sup> + *bx* + *c* in this case (see Fig. 2.3).\n\n![](_page_4_Figure_3.jpeg)\n\n**Case (ii) :** Here, the graph cuts the *x*-axis at exactly one point, i.e., at two coincident points. So, the two points A and A of Case (i) coincide here to become one point A (see Fig. 2.4).\n\n![](_page_4_Figure_5.jpeg)\n\n**Fig. 2.4**\n\nThe *x*-coordinate of A is the **only zero** for the quadratic polynomial *ax*<sup>2</sup> + *bx* + *c* in this case.\n\n![](_page_5_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\n**Case (iii) :** Here, the graph is either completely above the *x*-axis or completely below the *x*-axis. So, it does not cut the *x*-axis at any point (see Fig. 2.5).\n\nSo, the quadratic polynomial *ax*<sup>2</sup> + *bx* + *c* has **no zero** in this case.\n\nSo, you can see geometrically that a quadratic polynomial can have either two distinct zeroes or two equal zeroes (i.e., one zero), or no zero. This also means that a polynomial of degree 2 has atmost two zeroes.\n\nNow, what do you expect the geometrical meaning of the zeroes of a cubic polynomial to be? Let us find out. Consider the cubic polynomial *x*<sup>3</sup> – 4*x*. To see what the graph of *y* = *x*<sup>3</sup> – 4*x* looks like, let us list a few values of *y* corresponding to a few values for *x* as shown in Table 2.2.\n\n|                | Table 2.2 |    |   |    |   |  |  |\n|----------------|-----------|----|---|----|---|--|--|\n| x              | –2        | –1 | 0 | 1  | 2 |  |  |\n| y = x3<br>– 4x | 0         | 3  | 0 | –3 | 0 |  |  |\n\nLocating the points of the table on a graph paper and drawing the graph, we see that the graph of *y* = *x*<sup>3</sup> – 4*x* actually looks like the one given in Fig. 2.6.\n\n16 MATHEMATICS\n\nWe see from the table above that – 2, 0 and 2 are zeroes of the cubic polynomial *x*<sup>3</sup> – 4*x*. Observe that – 2, 0 and 2 are, in fact, the *x*-coordinates of the only points where the graph of *y* = *x*<sup>3</sup> – 4*x* intersects the *x*-axis. Since the curve meets the *x*-axis in only these 3 points, their *x*-coordinates are the only zeroes of the polynomial.\n\nLet us take a few more examples. Consider the cubic polynomials *x*<sup>3</sup> and *x*<sup>3</sup> – *x*<sup>2</sup> . We draw the graphs of *y* = *x*<sup>3</sup> and *y* = *x*<sup>3</sup> – *x*<sup>2</sup> in Fig. 2.7 and Fig. 2.8 respectively.\n\n![](_page_6_Figure_3.jpeg)\n\n**Fig. 2.6**\n\n![](_page_6_Figure_5.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_6_Figure_6.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_6_Figure_7.jpeg)\n\nNote that 0 is the only zero of the polynomial *x*<sup>3</sup> . Also, from Fig. 2.7, you can see that 0 is the *x*-coordinate of the only point where the graph of *y* = *x*<sup>3</sup> intersects the *x*-axis. Similarly, since *x*<sup>3</sup> – *x*<sup>2</sup> = *x*2 (*x* – 1), 0 and 1 are the only zeroes of the polynomial *x*3 – *x*<sup>2</sup> . Also, from Fig. 2.8, these values are the *x*-coordinates of the only points where the graph of *y* = *x*<sup>3</sup> – *x*<sup>2</sup> intersects the *x*-axis.\n\nFrom the examples above, we see that there are at most 3 zeroes for any cubic polynomial. In other words, any polynomial of degree 3 can have at most three zeroes.\n\n**Remark :** In general, given a polynomial *p*(*x*) of degree *n*, the graph of *y* = *p*(*x*) intersects the *x*-axis at atmost *n* points. Therefore, a polynomial *p*(*x*) of degree *n* has at most *n* zeroes.\n\n**Example 1 :** Look at the graphs in Fig. 2.9 given below. Each is the graph of *y* = *p*(*x*), where *p*(*x*) is a polynomial. For each of the graphs, find the number of zeroes of *p*(*x*).\n\n![](_page_7_Figure_5.jpeg)\n\n#### **Solution :**\n\n- (i) The number of zeroes is 1 as the graph intersects the *x*-axis at one point only.\n- (ii) The number of zeroes is 2 as the graph intersects the *x*-axis at two points.\n- (iii) The number of zeroes is 3. (Why?)\n\n- (iv) The number of zeroes is 1. (Why?)\n- (v) The number of zeroes is 1. (Why?)\n- (vi) The number of zeroes is 4. (Why?)\n\n#### **EXERCISE 2.1**\n\n**1.** The graphs of *y* = *p*(*x*) are given in Fig. 2.10 below, for some polynomials *p*(*x*). Find the number of zeroes of *p*(*x*), in each case.\n\n![](_page_8_Figure_6.jpeg)\n\n#### **2.3 Relationship between Zeroes and Coefficients of a Polynomial**\n\nYou have already seen that zero of a linear polynomial *ax* + *b* is *b <sup>a</sup>* . We will now try to answer the question raised in Section 2.1 regarding the relationship between zeroes and coefficients of a quadratic polynomial. For this, let us take a quadratic polynomial, say *p*(*x*) = 2*x*<sup>2</sup> – 8*x* + 6. In Class IX, you have learnt how to factorise quadratic polynomials by splitting the middle term. So, here we need to split the middle term '– 8*x*' as a sum of two terms, whose product is 6 × 2*x*<sup>2</sup> = 12*x*<sup>2</sup> . So, we write\n\n$$\n2x2 - 8x + 6 = 2x2 - 6x - 2x + 6 = 2x(x - 3) - 2(x - 3)\n$$\n$$\n= (2x - 2)(x - 3) = 2(x - 1)(x - 3)\n$$\n\nSo, the value of *p*(*x*) = 2*x*<sup>2</sup> – 8*x* + 6 is zero when *x* – 1 = 0 or *x* – 3 = 0, i.e., when *x* = 1 or *x* = 3. So, the zeroes of 2*x*<sup>2</sup> – 8*x* + 6 are 1 and 3. Observe that :\n\nSum of its zeroes \n$$\n= 1 + 3 = 4 = \\frac{-(-8)}{2} = \\frac{-(\\text{Coefficient of } x)}{\\text{Coefficient of } x^2}\n$$\n  \nProduct of its zeroes \n$$\n= 1 \\times 3 = 3 = \\frac{6}{2} = \\frac{\\text{Constant term}}{\\text{Coefficient of } x^2}\n$$\n\nLet us take one more quadratic polynomial, say, *p*(*x*) = 3*x*<sup>2</sup> + 5*x* – 2. By the method of splitting the middle term,\n\n$$\n3x2 + 5x - 2 = 3x2 + 6x - x - 2 = 3x(x + 2) -1(x + 2)\n$$\n  \n= (3x - 1)(x + 2)\n\nHence, the value of 3*x*<sup>2</sup> + 5*x* – 2 is zero when either 3*x* – 1 = 0 or *x* + 2 = 0, i.e., when *x* = <sup>1</sup> 3 or *x* = –2. So, the zeroes of 3*x*<sup>2</sup> + 5*x* – 2 are 1 3 and – 2. Observe that :\n\nSum of its zeroes \n$$\n=\\frac{1}{3} + (-2) = \\frac{-5}{3} = \\frac{-(\\text{Coefficient of } x)}{\\text{Coefficient of } x^2}\n$$\n\nProduct of its zeroes = \n$$\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times (-2) = \\frac{-2}{3} = \\frac{\\text{Constant term}}{\\text{Coefficient of } x^2}\n$$\n\nIn general, if \\* and \\* are the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial *p*(*x*) = *ax*<sup>2</sup> + *bx* + *c*, *a* 0, then you know that *x* – and *x* – are the factors of *p*(*x*). Therefore,\n\n$$\nax^{2} + bx + c = k(x - \\alpha) (x - \\beta), \\text{ where } k \\text{ is a constant}\n$$\n$$\n= k[x^{2} - (\\alpha + \\beta)x + \\alpha \\beta]\n$$\n$$\n= kx^{2} - k(\\alpha + \\beta)x + k \\alpha \\beta\n$$\n\nComparing the coefficients of *x*<sup>2</sup> , *x* and constant terms on both the sides, we get\n\n$$\na = k\n$$\n,  $b = -k(\\alpha + \\beta)$  and  $c = k\\alpha\\beta$ .\n\nThis gives \n$$\n\\alpha + \\beta = \\frac{-b}{a}\n$$\n,  \n$$\n\\alpha \\beta = \\frac{c}{a}\n$$\n\n<sup>\\*</sup> , are Greek letters pronounced as 'alpha' and 'beta' respectively. We will use later one more letter '' pronounced as 'gamma'.\n\ni.e., sum of zeroes = \n$$\n\\alpha + \\beta = -\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{-(\\text{Coefficient of } x)}{\\text{Coefficient of } x^2}\n$$\n,\n\nproduct of zeroes = \n$$\n\\alpha\\beta\n$$\n =  $\\frac{c}{a}$  =  $\\frac{\\text{Constant term}}{\\text{Coefficient of }x^2}$ .\n\nLet us consider some examples.\n\n**Example 2 :** Find the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial *x*<sup>2</sup> + 7*x* + 10, and verify the relationship between the zeroes and the coefficients.\n\n**Solution :** We have\n\n$$\nx^2 + 7x + 10 = (x + 2)(x + 5)\n$$\n\nSo, the value of *x*<sup>2</sup> + 7*x* + 10 is zero when *x* + 2 = 0 or *x* + 5 = 0, i.e., when *x* = – 2 or *x* = –5. Therefore, the zeroes of *x*<sup>2</sup> + 7*x* + 10 are – 2 and – 5. Now,\n\nsum of zeroes = \n$$\n-2 + (-5) = -(7) = \\frac{-(7)}{1} = \\frac{-(\\text{Coefficient of } x)}{\\text{Coefficient of } x^2}\n$$\n,\n\nproduct of zeroes = \n$$\n(-2) \\times (-5) = 10 = \\frac{10}{1} = \\frac{\\text{Constant term}}{\\text{Coefficient of } x^2}\n$$\n.\n\n**Example 3 :** Find the zeroes of the polynomial *x*<sup>2</sup> – 3 and verify the relationship between the zeroes and the coefficients.\n\n**Solution :** Recall the identity *a*<sup>2</sup> – *b*<sup>2</sup> = (*a* – *b*)(*a* + *b*). Using it, we can write:\n\n$$\nx^2 - 3 = \\left(x - \\sqrt{3}\\right)\\left(x + \\sqrt{3}\\right)\n$$\n\nSo, the value of *x*<sup>2</sup> – 3 is zero when *x* = 3 or *x* = – 3\n\nTherefore, the zeroes of *x*<sup>2</sup> – 3 are 3 and 3 Now,\n\nsum of zeroes = \n$$\n\\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{3} = 0 = \\frac{-(\\text{Coefficient of } x)}{\\text{Coefficient of } x^2}\n$$\n,\n\nproduct of zeroes = \n$$\n(\\sqrt{3})(-\\sqrt{3}) = -3 = \\frac{-3}{1} = \\frac{\\text{Constant term}}{\\text{Coefficient of }x^2}\n$$\n.\n\n**Example 4 :** Find a quadratic polynomial, the sum and product of whose zeroes are – 3 and 2, respectively.\n\n**Solution :** Let the quadratic polynomial be *ax*<sup>2</sup> + *bx* + *c*, and its zeroes be and . We have\n\n$$\n\\alpha + \\beta = -3 = \\frac{-b}{a},\n$$\n\nand \n$$\n\\alpha\\beta = 2 = \\frac{c}{a}\n$$\n.\n\nIf *a* = 1, then *b* = 3 and *c* = 2.\n\nSo, one quadratic polynomial which fits the given conditions is *x*<sup>2</sup> + 3*x* + 2.\n\nYou can check that any other quadratic polynomial that fits these conditions will be of the form *k*(*x*<sup>2</sup> + 3*x* + 2), where *k* is real.\n\nLet us now look at cubic polynomials. Do you think a similar relation holds between the zeroes of a cubic polynomial and its coefficients?\n\nLet us consider *p*(*x*) = 2*x*<sup>3</sup> – 5*x*<sup>2</sup> – 14*x* + 8.\n\nYou can check that *p*(*x*) = 0 for *x* = 4, – 2, <sup>1</sup> 2 Since *p*(*x*) can have atmost three zeroes, these are the zeores of 2*x*<sup>3</sup> – 5*x*<sup>2</sup> – 14*x* + 8. Now,\n\nsum of the zeroes = \n$$\n4 + (-2) + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{-(-5)}{2} = \\frac{-(\\text{Coefficient of } x^2)}{\\text{Coefficient of } x^3}\n$$\n,\n\nproduct of the zeroes = \n$$\n4 \\times (-2) \\times \\frac{1}{2} = -4 = \\frac{-8}{2} = \\frac{-\\text{Constant term}}{\\text{Coefficient of } x^3}\n$$\n.\n\nHowever, there is one more relationship here.

The key insight is that zeroes of a polynomial correspond geometrically to the x-coordinates where the graph intersects the x-axis. For quadratic polynomials ax² + bx + c, if α and β are the zeroes, then α + β = -b/a and αβ = c/a. The chapter demonstrates that a polynomial of degree n can have at most n zeroes, with quadratic polynomials having at most 2 zeroes and cubic polynomials having at most 3 zeroes. These relationships allow us to find zeroes given coefficients, or construct polynomials given information about their zeroes."
