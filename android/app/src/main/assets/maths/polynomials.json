For instance, the area of a square with side 'a' is a², and the volume of a cube with side 'a' is a³. These expressions involving variables and their powers are called polynomials.</p><p>A polynomial is an algebraic expression consisting of variables and coefficients, involving only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents of variables.</p><h2>2.2 Definition and Examples of Polynomials</h2><p>A polynomial in one variable x is an expression of the form:</p><p>p(x) = a₀ + a₁x + a₂x² + a₃x³ + ... + aₙxⁿ</p><p>where a₀, a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ are real numbers and aₙ ≠ 0.</p><p><strong>Examples of polynomials:</strong></p><p>• 2x + 3<br>• x² - 5x + 6<br>• 4x³ + 2x² - x + 7<br>• 5 (constant polynomial)</p><p><strong>Examples of expressions that are NOT polynomials:</strong></p><p>• x⁻¹ + 2 (negative exponent)<br>• √x + 3 (fractional exponent)<br>• 1/x + 5 (variable in denominator)</p><h2>2.3 Types of Polynomials</h2><p>Based on the number of terms, polynomials are classified as:</p><p><strong>1. Monomial:</strong> A polynomial with only one term<br>Examples: 5x, -3x², 7</p><p><strong>2. Binomial:</strong> A polynomial with exactly two terms<br>Examples: x + 5, 2x² - 3x, x³ + 1</p><p><strong>3. Trinomial:</strong> A polynomial with exactly three terms<br>Examples: x² + 2x + 1, 2x³ - x + 4</p><h2>2.4 Degree of a Polynomial</h2><p>The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial.</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong></p><p>• Degree of 3x + 5 is 1 (linear polynomial)<br>• Degree of x² - 4x + 3 is 2 (quadratic polynomial)<br>• Degree of 2x³ + x² - x + 1 is 3 (cubic polynomial)<br>• Degree of 7 is 0 (constant polynomial)</p><h2>2.5 Value of a Polynomial</h2><p>If p(x) is a polynomial in x, and if k is any real number, then the value obtained by replacing x by k in p(x) is called the value of p(x) at x = k, and is denoted by p(k).</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> If p(x) = x² + 2x + 1, then:</p><p>p(2) = (2)² + 2(2) + 1 = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9</p><h2>2.6 Zeros of a Polynomial</h2><p>A real number k is called a zero of a polynomial p(x), if p(k) = 0.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> For p(x) = x - 2, we have p(2) = 2 - 2 = 0<br>Therefore, 2 is a zero of the polynomial x - 2.</p><p><strong>Important Facts about Zeros:</strong></p><p>• A linear polynomial has at most one zero<br>• A quadratic polynomial has at most two zeros<br>• In general, a polynomial of degree n has at most n zeros</p><h2>2.7 Relationship between Zeros and Coefficients</h2><p><strong>For a quadratic polynomial ax² + bx + c:</strong></p><p>If α and β are the zeros, then:</p><p>• Sum of zeros: α + β = -b/a<br>• Product of zeros: α × β = c/a</p><p><strong>For a cubic polynomial ax³ + bx² + cx + d:</strong></p><p>If α, β, and γ are the zeros, then:</p><p>• Sum of zeros: α + β + γ = -b/a<br>• Sum of products taken two at a time: αβ + βγ + γα = c/a<br>• Product of zeros: αβγ = -d/a</p><h2>2.8 Division Algorithm for Polynomials</h2><p>If p(x) and g(x) are any two polynomials with g(x) ≠ 0, then we can find polynomials q(x) and r(x) such that:</p><p>p(x) = g(x) × q(x) + r(x)</p><p>where r(x) = 0 or degree of r(x) < degree of g(x).</p><p>Here, p(x) is called the dividend, g(x) is called the divisor, q(x) is called the quotient, and r(x) is called the remainder.</p><h2>2.9 Remainder Theorem</h2><p>If a polynomial p(x) is divided by (x - a), then the remainder is p(a).</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Find the remainder when p(x) = x³ - 2x² + x + 2 is divided by (x - 1).</p><p>By remainder theorem, remainder = p(1) = 1³ - 2(1)² + 1 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 1 + 2 = 2</p><h2>2.10 Factor Theorem</h2><p>If p(x) is a polynomial of degree n ≥ 1 and a is any real number, then:</p><p>• (x - a) is a factor of p(x) if and only if p(a) = 0<br>• p(a) = 0 if and only if (x - a) is a factor of p(x)</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Check whether (x - 2) is a factor of p(x) = x³ - 3x² + 4x - 2.</p><p>p(2) = 2³ - 3(2)² + 4(2) - 2 = 8 - 12 + 8 - 2 = 2 ≠ 0</p><p>Since p(2) ≠ 0, (x - 2) is not a factor of p(x).</p>",

We learned to classify polynomials based on their degree (linear, quadratic, cubic) and number of terms (monomial, binomial, trinomial). The concept of zeros of polynomials is fundamental, where a zero is a value that makes the polynomial equal to zero.</p><p>Key relationships were established between zeros and coefficients of polynomials, particularly for quadratic and cubic polynomials. The division algorithm provides a systematic method for polynomial division, while the remainder theorem offers a quick way to find remainders. The factor theorem connects zeros with factors, stating that (x - a) is a factor of p(x) if and only if p(a) = 0. These concepts form the foundation for solving polynomial equations and understanding their graphical behavior.</p>"
