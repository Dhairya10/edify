Recall that the portion (or part) of the circular region enclosed by two radii and the corresponding arc is called a *sector* of the circle and the portion (or part) of the circular region enclosed between a chord and the corresponding arc is called a *segment* of the circle. Thus, in Fig. 11.1, shaded region OAPB is a *sector* of the circle with centre O. ∠ AOB is called the\n\n*angle* of the sector. Note that in this figure, unshaded region OAQB is also a sector of the circle. For obvious reasons, OAPB is called the *minor sector* and OAQB is called the *major sector*. You can also see that angle of the major sector is 360° – ∠ AOB.\n\nNow, look at Fig. 11.2 in which AB is a chord of the circle with centre O. So, shaded region APB is a segment of the circle. You can also note that unshaded region AQB is another segment of the circle formed by the chord AB. For obvious reasons, APB is called the *minor segment* and AQB is called the *major segment*.\n\n**Remark :** When we write 'segment' and 'sector' we will mean the 'minor segment' and the 'minor sector' respectively, unless stated otherwise.\n\n![](_page_0_Figure_7.jpeg)\n\n**11**\n\n![](_page_0_Figure_8.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_0_Picture_9.jpeg)\n\n#### AREAS RELATED TO CIRCLES 155\n\nNow with this knowledge, let us try to find some relations (or formulae) to calculate their areas.\n\nLet OAPB be a sector of a circle with centre O and radius *r* (see Fig. 11.3). Let the degree measure of Ð AOB be q.\n\nYou know that area of a circle (in fact of a circular region or disc) is p*r* 2 .\n\nIn a way, we can consider this circular region to be a sector forming an angle of 360° (i.e., of degree measure 360) at the centre O. Now by applying the Unitary Method, we can arrive at the area of the sector OAPB as follows:\n\n![](_page_1_Figure_5.jpeg)\n\nWhen degree measure of the angle at the centre is 360, area of the sector = p*r* 2\n\nSo, when the degree measure of the angle at the centre is 1, area of the sector = 2 *r*\n\nTherefore, when the degree measure of the angle at the centre is q, area of the\n\n$$\nsector = \\frac{\\pi r^2}{360} \\times \\theta = \\frac{\\theta}{360} \\times \\pi r^2.\n$$\n\n360\n\nThus, we obtain the following relation (or formula) for area of a sector of a circle:\n\nArea of the sector of angle \n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{\\theta}{360} \\times \\pi r^2\n$$\n,\n\nwhere *r* is the radius of the circle and q the angle of the sector in degrees.\n\nNow, a natural question arises : Can we find the length of the arc APB corresponding to this sector? Yes. Again, by applying the Unitary Method and taking the whole length of the circle (of angle 360°) as 2p*r*, we can obtain the required\n\nlength of the arc APB as \n$$\n\\frac{\\theta}{360} \\times 2\\pi r\n$$\n.\n\nSo, **length of an arc of a sector of angle** q **= 2 360** *r* .\n\n![](_page_1_Figure_16.jpeg)\n\nNow let us take the case of the area of the segment APB of a circle with centre O and radius *r* (see Fig. 11.4). You can see that :\n\nArea of the segment APB = Area of the sector OAPB – Area of OAB\n\n$$\n= \\frac{\\theta}{360} \\times \\pi r^2 - \\text{area of } \\Delta \\text{OAB}\n$$\n\n**Note :** From Fig. 11.3 and Fig. 11.4 respectively, you can observe that:\n\nArea of the major sector OAQB = *r*<sup>2</sup> – Area of the minor sector OAPB and Area of major segment AQB = *r*<sup>2</sup> – Area of the minor segment APB Let us now take some examples to understand these concepts (or results).\n\n![](_page_2_Figure_6.jpeg)\n\nArea of the corresponding major sector\n\n$$\n= \\pi r^2 - \\text{area of sector OAPB}\n$$\n  \n= (3.14 × 16 – 4.19) cm<sup>2</sup>  \n= 46.05 cm<sup>2</sup> = 46.1 cm<sup>2</sup>(approx.)\n\n**Alternatively,** area of the major sector = <sup>2</sup> (360 – ) 360 *r*\n\n$$\n= \\left(\\frac{360 - 30}{360}\\right) \\times 3.14 \\times 16 \\text{ cm}^2\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{330}{360} \\times 3.14 \\times 16 \\text{ cm}^2 = 46.05 \\text{ cm}^2\n$$\n$$\n= 46.1 \\text{ cm}^2 \\text{ (approx.)}\n$$\n\n**Example 2 :** Find the area of the segment AYB shown in Fig. 11.6, if radius of the circle is 21 cm and\n\n$$\n\\angle\n$$\nAOB = 120°. (Use  $\\pi = \\frac{22}{7}$ )\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_3.jpeg)\n\n**Solution :** Area of the segment AYB\n\n= Area of sector OAYB – Area of OAB (1)\n\nNow, area of the sector OAYB = \n$$\n\\frac{120}{360} \\times \\frac{22}{7} \\times 21 \\times 21 \\text{ cm}^2 = 462 \\text{ cm}^2\n$$\n (2)\n\nFor finding the area of OAB, draw OM AB as shown in Fig. 11.7. Note that OA = OB. Therefore, by RHS congruence, AMO BMO.\n\nSo, M is the mid-point of AB and AOM = BOM = <sup>1</sup> 120 60 2 .\n\n| Let             | OM =<br>x cm                                                                      |               |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| So, from  OMA, | OM<br>=<br>cos 60°<br>OA                                                          |               |\n| or,             | 1<br>1<br>x<br><br><br>cos<br>60°<br>=<br>=<br><br><br>2<br>2<br>21<br><br> | Fig. 11.7     |\n| or,             | 21<br>x =<br>2                                                                    |               |\n| So,             | 21<br>OM =<br>cm<br>2                                                             |               |\n| Also,           | AM<br>3<br>=<br>sin 60° =<br>OA<br>2                                              |               |\n| So,             | 21<br>3<br>AM =<br>cm<br>2                                                        |               |\n| Therefore,      | 2<br>21<br>3<br><br>cm<br>=<br>AB =<br>2 AM =<br>2                               | 21<br>3<br>cm |\n\nSo, area of \n$$\n\\triangle OAB = \\frac{1}{2} AB \\times OM = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 21\\sqrt{3} \\times \\frac{21}{2}\n$$\n cm<sup>2</sup>  \n$$\n= \\frac{441}{4} \\sqrt{3}\n$$\n cm<sup>2</sup> (3)\n\nTherefore, area of the segment AYB = <sup>441</sup> <sup>2</sup> 462 3 cm 4 [From (1), (2) and (3)]\n\n$$\n= \\frac{21}{4} (88 - 21\\sqrt{3}) \\text{cm}^2\n$$\n\n### **EXERCISE 11.1**\n\nUnless stated otherwise, use = <sup>22</sup> 7 .\n\n- **1.** Find the area of a sector of a circle with radius 6 cm if angle of the sector is 60°.\n- **2.** Find the area of a quadrant of a circle whose circumference is 22 cm.\n- **3.** The length of the minute hand of a clock is 14 cm.

        "answer": "(i) The horse can graze in a quarter circle of radius 5 m. Area = (1/4) × 3.14 × 5² = 19.625 m². (ii) With 10 m rope, area = (1/4) × 3.14 × 10² = 78.5 m². Increase = 78.5 - 19.625 = 58.875 m²"

        "answer": "(i) Total wire = Circumference + 5 diameters = π × 35 + 5 × 35 = (22/7) × 35 + 175 = 110 + 175 = 285 mm. (ii) Each sector has angle 36°. Area = (36/360) × (22/7) × (17.5)² = (1/10) × (22/7) × 306.25 = 96.25 mm²"

        "answer": "Each design is a sector with angle 60°. Area of one design = (60/360) × (22/7) × 28² = (1/6) × (22/7) × 784 = 410.67 cm². Total area of 6 designs = 6 × 410.67 = 2464 cm². Cost = 2464 × 0.35 = ₹ 862.40"

        "answer": "The correct formula for the area of a sector is (p/360) × πR², where p is the angle in degrees and R is the radius. This follows from the proportion that the sector area bears to the total circle area, which is the same as the proportion of the sector angle to 360°."

      "summary": "This chapter focuses on calculating areas and arc lengths related to circles, specifically sectors and segments. A sector is the region between two radii and an arc, while a segment is the region between a chord and an arc. The chapter provides formulas for calculating the area of sectors using the proportion method, where the sector area relates to the total circle area as the sector angle relates to 360°. It also covers finding arc lengths and segment areas by subtracting the triangular portion from the sector area. The concepts are applied to various practical problems involving clocks, grazing areas, wipers, and other real-world scenarios."
