When acids and bases react with each other, they form salts. Understanding the properties and behavior of acids, bases, and salts is crucial in chemistry and has numerous applications in our daily life.</p><h2>1.2 Understanding Acids and Bases</h2><h3>1.2.1 Acids</h3><p>Acids are substances that taste sour and change the color of blue litmus paper to red. The word 'acid' comes from the Latin word 'acidus' which means sour.</p><p><strong>Common Examples of Acids:</strong></p><p>• Hydrochloric acid (HCl) - found in gastric juice<br>• Sulphuric acid (H₂SO₄) - used in car batteries<br>• Nitric acid (HNO₃) - used in fertilizers<br>• Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) - found in vinegar<br>• Citric acid - found in citrus fruits<br>• Lactic acid - found in sour milk</p><h3>1.2.2 Bases</h3><p>Bases are substances that taste bitter and feel soapy to touch. They change red litmus paper to blue. Bases that are soluble in water are called alkalis.</p><p><strong>Common Examples of Bases:</strong></p><p>• Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) - used in soap making<br>• Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂) - lime water<br>• Potassium hydroxide (KOH) - used in detergents<br>• Magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)₂) - milk of magnesia<br>• Ammonium hydroxide (NH₄OH) - household cleaner</p><h2>1.3 Indicators</h2><p>Indicators are substances that show different colors in acidic and basic solutions. They help us identify whether a substance is acidic or basic.</p><h3>1.3.1 Natural Indicators</h3><p>Many natural substances can act as indicators:</p><p>• <strong>Litmus:</strong> Extracted from lichens. Blue litmus turns red in acidic solution, red litmus turns blue in basic solution.<br>• <strong>Turmeric:</strong> Yellow in acidic and neutral solutions, red in basic solutions.<br>• <strong>Red cabbage:</strong> Shows different colors in solutions of different pH.<br>• <strong>China rose petals:</strong> Change color in acidic and basic solutions.</p><h3>1.3.2 Synthetic Indicators</h3><p>• <strong>Methyl orange:</strong> Red in acidic solution, yellow in basic solution<br>• <strong>Phenolphthalein:</strong> Colorless in acidic solution, pink in basic solution</p><h2>1.4 Properties of Acids and Bases</h2><h3>1.4.1 Properties of Acids</h3><p>1. <strong>Taste:</strong> Acids have a sour taste<br>2. <strong>Effect on indicators:</strong> Turn blue litmus red<br>3. <strong>Reaction with metals:</strong> Acids react with metals to produce hydrogen gas<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metal + Acid → Salt + Hydrogen gas<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: Zn + H₂SO₄ → ZnSO₄ + H₂<br>4. <strong>Reaction with metal carbonates:</strong> Produce carbon dioxide gas<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metal carbonate + Acid → Salt + Water + Carbon dioxide<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: CaCO₃ + 2HCl → CaCl₂ + H₂O + CO₂<br>5. <strong>Reaction with bases:</strong> Neutralization reaction occurs<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acid + Base → Salt + Water</p><h3>1.4.2 Properties of Bases</h3><p>1. <strong>Taste:</strong> Bases have a bitter taste<br>2. <strong>Touch:</strong> Feel soapy to touch<br>3. <strong>Effect on indicators:</strong> Turn red litmus blue<br>4. <strong>Reaction with acids:</strong> Neutralization reaction occurs<br>5. <strong>Reaction with metals:</strong> Some bases react with metals to produce hydrogen gas</p><h2>1.5 Acids and Bases in Water Solutions</h2><p>Acids and bases show their properties only in the presence of water. This is because acids produce hydrogen ions (H⁺) in water, while bases produce hydroxide ions (OH⁻) in water.</p><p><strong>Acids in water:</strong> HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻<br><strong>Bases in water:</strong> NaOH → Na⁺ + OH⁻</p><h2>1.6 Strength of Acid and Base Solutions</h2><p>The strength of acids and bases can be measured using the pH scale, which ranges from 0 to 14.</p><p>• <strong>pH < 7:</strong> Acidic solution<br>• <strong>pH = 7:</strong> Neutral solution<br>• <strong>pH > 7:</strong> Basic solution</p><p>The closer the pH is to 0, the more acidic the solution. The closer the pH is to 14, the more basic the solution.</p><h2>1.7 Importance of pH in Everyday Life</h2><h3>1.7.1 pH in Our Digestive System</h3><p>Our stomach produces hydrochloric acid which helps in digestion. The pH of stomach acid is about 1.2. When excess acid is produced, it causes acidity. Antacids like milk of magnesia are used to neutralize excess acid.</p><h3>1.7.2 pH Change as Cause of Tooth Decay</h3><p>Bacteria in our mouth produce acids by degrading sugar and food particles. When pH falls below 5.5, tooth enamel gets corroded, causing tooth decay. Using toothpaste (which is basic) helps neutralize the acid.</p><h3>1.7.3 Self Defense by Animals and Plants</h3><p>Bee stings inject methanoic acid, causing pain. Baking soda (sodium hydrogen carbonate) can be applied to neutralize the acid. Nettle leaves also inject methanoic acid when touched.</p><h3>1.7.4 Soil pH</h3><p>Most plants grow best in soil with pH close to 7. If soil is too acidic, slaked lime is added. If soil is too basic, organic matter is added to make it suitable for plant growth.</p><h2>1.8 Salts</h2><p>Salts are ionic compounds formed by the neutralization reaction between acids and bases. The general reaction is:</p><p><strong>Acid + Base → Salt + Water</strong></p><h3>1.8.1 Family of Salts</h3><p>Salts having common ions are said to belong to the same family:</p><p>• <strong>Chloride family:</strong> NaCl, KCl, MgCl₂ (contain Cl⁻ ion)<br>• <strong>Sulphate family:</strong> Na₂SO₄, K₂SO₄, MgSO₄ (contain SO₄²⁻ ion)<br>• <strong>Sodium family:</strong> NaCl, Na₂SO₄, NaNO₃ (contain Na⁺ ion)</p><h3>1.8.2 pH of Salt Solutions</h3><p>• <strong>Salt of strong acid and strong base:</strong> Neutral (pH = 7)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: NaCl<br>• <strong>Salt of strong acid and weak base:</strong> Acidic (pH < 7)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: NH₄Cl<br>• <strong>Salt of weak acid and strong base:</strong> Basic (pH > 7)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: Na₂CO₃</p><h2>1.9 Important Salts and Their Uses</h2><h3>1.9.1 Sodium Chloride (NaCl)</h3><p>Common salt is obtained from sea water by evaporation. It is used for:</p><p>• Seasoning and preservation of food<br>• Manufacturing of sodium hydroxide, hydrogen gas, and chlorine gas<br>• De-icing of roads in cold countries</p><h3>1.9.2 Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH)</h3><p>Also called caustic soda, it is manufactured by chlor-alkali process:</p><p>2NaCl + 2H₂O → 2NaOH + Cl₂ + H₂</p><p>Uses:<br>• Manufacturing of soap and detergents<br>• Paper making<br>• Textile industry</p><h3>1.9.3 Bleaching Powder (CaOCl₂)</h3><p>Prepared by passing chlorine gas over dry slaked lime:</p><p>Ca(OH)₂ + Cl₂ → CaOCl₂ + H₂O</p><p>Uses:<br>• Bleaching cotton and linen in textile industry<br>• Disinfectant for drinking water<br>• Oxidizing agent in chemical industry</p><h3>1.9.4 Baking Soda (NaHCO₃)</h3><p>Sodium hydrogen carbonate is used for:</p><p>• Making cakes and bread fluffy<br>• Antacid to neutralize excess stomach acid<br>• Fire extinguisher<br>• Cleaning agent</p><h3>1.9.5 Washing Soda (Na₂CO₃.10H₂O)</h3><p>Sodium carbonate decahydrate is used for:</p><p>• Washing clothes<br>• Removing permanent hardness of water<br>• Glass and paper industry</p><h3>1.9.6 Plaster of Paris (CaSO₄.½H₂O)</h3><p>Prepared by heating gypsum at 373K:</p><p>CaSO₄.2H₂O → CaSO₄.½H₂O + 1½H₂O</p><p>Uses:<br>• Making plaster casts for broken bones<br>• Making statues and decorative materials<br>• Fire-proofing material</p><h2>1.10 Water of Crystallization</h2><p>Many salts contain water molecules as part of their crystal structure. This water is called water of crystallization.</p><p>Examples:<br>• Gypsum: CaSO₄.2H₂O<br>• Washing soda: Na₂CO₃.10H₂O<br>• Blue vitriol: CuSO₄.5H₂O</p><p>When crystals are heated, they lose water of crystallization and their color may change.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>When zinc metal reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid, hydrogen gas is evolved along with the formation of zinc chloride salt. This is a typical acid-metal reaction.</p><p><strong>Chemical equation:</strong><br>Zn + 2HCl → ZnCl₂ + H₂↑</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>In this reaction, zinc displaces hydrogen from hydrochloric acid because zinc is more reactive than hydrogen. The hydrogen gas can be identified by bringing a burning splinter near the mouth of the test tube - it burns with a 'pop' sound. This reaction demonstrates one of the important properties of acids - their ability to react with metals to produce hydrogen gas and corresponding salt.</p>"
