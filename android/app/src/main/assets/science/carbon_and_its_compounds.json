        "html_content": "<h1>Chapter 4: Carbon and its Compounds</h1><br><h2>4.1 Introduction</h2><p>Carbon is one of the most important elements in nature. It forms the basis of all living organisms and is found in a vast variety of compounds. The element carbon has the unique property of forming long chains and rings with itself, which gives rise to millions of organic compounds. This property is called catenation. Carbon compounds are essential for life processes and form the backbone of organic chemistry.</p><br><h2>4.2 Bonding in Carbon</h2><p>Carbon has atomic number 6, which means it has 6 electrons. The electronic configuration of carbon is 2, 4. This means carbon has 4 electrons in its outermost shell (valence shell). To complete its octet, carbon needs 4 more electrons.</p><p>Carbon can achieve this stable configuration by:</p><p>1. Sharing electrons with other atoms (covalent bonding)<br>2. Forming single, double, or triple bonds<br>3. Bonding with other carbon atoms or different elements</p><br><h3>4.2.1 Covalent Bonding</h3><p>Carbon forms covalent bonds by sharing electrons with other atoms. Since carbon has 4 valence electrons, it can form 4 covalent bonds. This tetravalent nature of carbon allows it to form stable compounds with hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and other elements.</p><br><h3>4.2.2 Types of Covalent Bonds</h3><p><strong>Single Bond:</strong> When two atoms share one pair of electrons, it forms a single bond. Example: C-C, C-H</p><p><strong>Double Bond:</strong> When two atoms share two pairs of electrons, it forms a double bond. Example: C=C, C=O</p><p><strong>Triple Bond:</strong> When two atoms share three pairs of electrons, it forms a triple bond. Example: C≡C</p><br><h2>4.3 Versatile Nature of Carbon</h2><h3>4.3.1 Catenation</h3><p>Catenation is the ability of carbon atoms to form bonds with other carbon atoms. This property allows carbon to form:</p><p>1. Long straight chains<br>2. Branched chains<br>3. Rings of different sizes</p><p>This unique property of carbon leads to the formation of a large number of carbon compounds.</p><br><h3>4.3.2 Tetravalency</h3><p>Carbon has a valency of four, meaning it can form four covalent bonds. This allows carbon to bond with:</p><p>1. Four hydrogen atoms (methane - CH₄)<br>2. Other carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms<br>3. Atoms of other elements like oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, etc.</p><br><h2>4.4 Hydrocarbons</h2><p>Hydrocarbons are compounds made up of only carbon and hydrogen atoms. They are the simplest organic compounds and form the basis for more complex organic molecules.</p><br><h3>4.4.1 Saturated Hydrocarbons (Alkanes)</h3><p>Saturated hydrocarbons contain only single bonds between carbon atoms. They are also called alkanes. The general formula for alkanes is CₙH₂ₙ₊₂.</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong></p><p>1. Methane (CH₄) - 1 carbon atom<br>2. Ethane (C₂H₆) - 2 carbon atoms<br>3. Propane (C₃H₈) - 3 carbon atoms<br>4. Butane (C₄H₁₀) - 4 carbon atoms</p><br><h3>4.4.2 Unsaturated Hydrocarbons</h3><p>Unsaturated hydrocarbons contain at least one double or triple bond between carbon atoms.</p><p><strong>Alkenes:</strong> Contain at least one double bond (C=C). General formula: CₙH₂ₙ</p><p>Examples: Ethene (C₂H₄), Propene (C₃H₆)</p><p><strong>Alkynes:</strong> Contain at least one triple bond (C≡C). General formula: CₙH₂ₙ₋₂</p><p>Examples: Ethyne (C₂H₂), Propyne (C₃H₄)</p><br><h2>4.5 Functional Groups</h2><p>A functional group is an atom or group of atoms that determines the chemical properties of an organic compound. Different functional groups give different properties to carbon compounds.</p><br><h3>4.5.1 Important Functional Groups</h3><p><strong>1. Alcohol (-OH):</strong> Example - Ethanol (C₂H₅OH)</p><p><strong>2. Aldehyde (-CHO):</strong> Example - Methanal (HCHO)</p><p><strong>3. Ketone (-CO-):</strong> Example - Propanone (CH₃COCH₃)</p><p><strong>4. Carboxylic Acid (-COOH):</strong> Example - Ethanoic acid (CH₃COOH)</p><p><strong>5. Ester (-COO-):</strong> Example - Ethyl ethanoate (CH₃COOC₂H₅)</p><br><h2>4.6 Nomenclature of Carbon Compounds</h2><p>The naming of organic compounds follows specific rules set by IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry).</p><br><h3>4.6.1 Basic Rules</h3><p>1. Identify the longest carbon chain<br>2. Number the carbon atoms in the chain<br>3. Identify and name the functional group<br>4. Name any substituents (side chains)<br>5. Write the complete name</p><br><h2>4.7 Chemical Properties of Carbon Compounds</h2><h3>4.7.1 Combustion</h3><p>Most carbon compounds burn in the presence of oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water, releasing energy.</p><p>Example: CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O + Energy</p><br><h3>4.7.2 Oxidation</h3><p>Carbon compounds can be oxidized by oxidizing agents like potassium permanganate (KMnO₄) or potassium dichromate (K₂Cr₂O₇).</p><p>Example: Ethanol can be oxidized to ethanoic acid</p><p>C₂H₅OH + [O] → CH₃COOH + H₂O</p><br><h3>4.7.3 Addition Reactions</h3><p>Unsaturated hydrocarbons undergo addition reactions where atoms or groups of atoms are added across the double or triple bonds.</p><p>Example: C₂H₄ + H₂ → C₂H₆ (Hydrogenation)</p><br><h3>4.7.4 Substitution Reactions</h3><p>In substitution reactions, one or more hydrogen atoms in a hydrocarbon are replaced by other atoms or groups.</p><p>Example: CH₄ + Cl₂ → CH₃Cl + HCl (in presence of sunlight)</p><br><h2>4.8 Important Carbon Compounds in Daily Life</h2><h3>4.8.1 Ethanol</h3><p>Ethanol (C₂H₅OH) is commonly known as alcohol. It is used in alcoholic beverages, as a solvent, and as fuel. It can be prepared by fermentation of sugars.</p><br><h3>4.8.2 Ethanoic Acid</h3><p>Ethanoic acid (CH₃COOH) is commonly known as acetic acid. It is the main component of vinegar (5-8% solution). It is used in food preservation and in the manufacture of various chemicals.</p><br><h3>4.8.3 Soaps and Detergents</h3><p>Soaps are sodium or potassium salts of long-chain carboxylic acids (fatty acids). They are prepared by the saponification of fats and oils with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide.</p><p>Detergents are synthetic cleaning agents that work better than soaps in hard water.</p><br><h2>4.9 Conclusion</h2><p>Carbon and its compounds form the foundation of organic chemistry and are essential for life on Earth.

                "question": "What is catenation? Explain why carbon shows this property more than other elements.",
                "answer": "<p>Catenation is the ability of an atom to form bonds with other atoms of the same element, forming chains and rings. Carbon shows catenation more than other elements due to the following reasons:</p><p>1. <strong>Small size:</strong> Carbon atoms are small, which allows for effective overlap of orbitals and formation of strong covalent bonds.</p><p>2. <strong>Tetravalency:</strong> Carbon has four valence electrons, allowing it to form four strong covalent bonds.</p><p>3. <strong>Similar electronegativity:</strong> C-C bonds are non-polar because both atoms have the same electronegativity, making the bonds stable.</p><p>4. <strong>Appropriate bond strength:</strong> C-C bonds are strong enough to be stable but not so strong that they cannot be broken during chemical reactions.</p><p>Other elements like silicon can also show catenation, but their larger size and weaker bonds make them less capable of forming long, stable chains compared to carbon.</p>"

                "answer": "<p><strong>Complete Combustion of Methane:</strong></p><p>When methane burns in sufficient oxygen, complete combustion occurs:</p><p>CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O + Energy</p><p>This reaction produces carbon dioxide, water vapor, and releases a large amount of energy in the form of heat and light.</p><br><p><strong>Incomplete Combustion:</strong></p><p>When methane burns in insufficient oxygen, incomplete combustion occurs:</p><p>2CH₄ + 3O₂ → 2CO + 4H₂O + Energy</p><p>or</p><p>CH₄ + O₂ → C + 2H₂O + Energy</p><p>In insufficient oxygen, carbon monoxide (CO) or carbon (soot) is formed instead of carbon dioxide. Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas, and the formation of soot makes the flame luminous and yellow. Less energy is released compared to complete combustion.</p>"

                "answer": "<p><strong>Formation of Soap (Saponification):</strong></p><p>Soaps are formed by the saponification reaction between fats/oils and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH):</p><p>Fat/Oil + NaOH → Soap + Glycerol</p><p>Chemically: R-COO-Na⁺ (where R is a long hydrocarbon chain)</p><p>This process involves heating fats or oils with concentrated sodium hydroxide solution. The reaction breaks down the fat molecules into glycerol and sodium salts of fatty acids (soap).</p><br><p><strong>Why soaps don't work well in hard water:</strong></p><p>Hard water contains dissolved calcium (Ca²⁺) and magnesium (Mg²⁺) ions. When soap is added to hard water, these ions react with soap to form insoluble precipitates:</p><p>2C₁₇H₃₅COONa + Ca²⁺ → (C₁₇H₃₅COO)₂Ca + 2Na⁺</p><p>These precipitates appear as scum or curdy white solid, which:</p><p>1. Reduces the effectiveness of soap</p><p>2. Wastes soap</p><p>3. Sticks to clothes and skin</p><p>4. Clogs fabric fibers</p>"
