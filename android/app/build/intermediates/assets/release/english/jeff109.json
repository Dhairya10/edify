Can you guess what sort of proposal the play is about?\n  - (i) a suggestion, plan or scheme for doing something\n  - (ii) an offer for a possible plan or action\n  - (iii) the act of asking someone's hand in marriage\n\n### A Russian Wedding\n\nDo you know anything about a Russian marriage ceremony? Read this article about a Russian wedding.\n\nPreparations for a Russian Wedding: A Russian wedding is very simple. The planning only includes arranging for rings, brides' dress, cars, and a reception. Earlier, the bride's family paid for the reception, but now-a-days brides' and grooms' families usually share expenses. A Russian wedding lasts for two days; some weddings last as long as a week, and the occasion becomes something to remember for years. The necessary part of the wedding ceremony is a wedding procession of several cars. The best friends of the groom/ bride meet before the wedding a few times, make posters, write speeches and organise contests. When the groom arrives to fetch the bride for the registration, he has to fight to get her! Russians usually live in apartments in tall buildings, and the groom has to climb several stairs to reach his bride. But at each landing he must answer a question to be allowed to go up. The bride's friends ask difficult questions (sometimes about the bride, sometimes just difficult riddles), and the groom must answer with the help of his friends. For example, he may be shown a few photos of baby girls and he must say which one his bride is. If he guesses wrong, he must pay cash to move ahead. After the\n\nmarriage registration, the newly-married couple leaves the guests for a tour of the city sights. After two or three hours of the city tour the couple arrives at the reception. The couple sits at a specially arranged table with their family, friends and invited guests. The reception starts with toasts to the couple. A wedding toast is a custom where a close friend or relative of the groom or the bride says a few words to wish the couple, then everyone raises their glass of wine, and drink it up at the same moment. The groom is then asked to kiss the bride. After a few toasts, people start eating and drinking, and generally have fun. After some time, the bride gets 'stolen'! She disappears, and when the groom starts looking for her, he is asked to pay a fee. Usually it is his friends who 'steal' the bride. Then there are the bride's friends \u2014 they steal the bride's shoe. The groom must pay money for the shoe too. The guests enjoy watching these tussles, and continue partying.\n\n2. Do you think Indian and Russian weddings have any customs in common?

It was written in 1888\u201389.\n\nThe play is about the tendency of wealthy families to seek ties with other wealthy families, to increase their estates by encouraging marriages that make good economic sense. Ivan Lomov, a long time wealthy neighbour of Stepan Chubukov, also wealthy, comes to seek the hand of Chubukov's twenty-five-year-old daughter, Natalya. All three are quarrelsome people, and they quarrel over petty issues. The proposal is in danger of being forgotten amidst all this quarrelling. But economic good sense ensures that the proposal is made, after all \u2014 although the quarrelling perhaps continues!\n\n| Characters                   |   |                                        |\n|------------------------------|---|----------------------------------------|\n| STEPAN STEPANOVITCH CHUBUKOV | : | a landowner                            |\n| NATALYA STEPANOVNA           | : | his daughter, twenty-five years old    |\n| IVAN VASSILEVITCH LOMOV      | : | a neighbour of Chubukov, a large and   |\n|                              |   | hearty, but very suspicious, landowner |\n\n### A drawing-room in Chubukov's house.\n\nLomov enters, wearing a dress-jacket and white gloves. Chubukov rises to meet him.\n\n- CHUBUKOV : My dear fellow, whom do I see! Ivan Vassilevitch! I am extremely glad! [Squeezes his hand] Now this is a surprise, my darling... How are you?\n- LOMOV : Thank you. And how may you be getting on?\n- CHUBUKOV : We just get along somehow, my angel, thanks to your prayers, and so on. Sit down, please do... Now, you know, you shouldn't forget all about your neighbours, my darling. My dear fellow, why are you so formal in your get-up! Evening dress, gloves, and so on. Can you be going anywhere, my treasure?\n- LOMOV : No. I've come only to see you, honoured Stepan Stepanovitch.\n- CHUBUKOV : Then why are you in evening dress, my precious? As if you're paying a New Year's Eve visit!\n- LOMOV : Well, you see, it's like this. [Takes his arm] I've come to you, honoured Stepan Stepanovitch, to trouble you with a request. Not once or twice have I already had the privilege of applying to you for help, and you have always, so to speak... I must ask your pardon, I am getting excited. I shall drink some water, honoured Stepan Stepanovitch.\n  - [Drinks.]\n- CHUBUKOV : [aside] He's come to borrow money. Shan't give him any! [aloud] What is it, my beauty?\n- LOMOV : You see, Honoured Stepanitch... I beg pardon Stepan Honouritch... I mean, I'm awfully excited, as you will please notice... In short, you alone can help me, though I don't deserve it, of course... and haven't any right to count on your assistance...\n\n122First Flight\n\nCHUBUKOV : Oh, don't go round and round it, darling! Spit it out! Well? LOMOV : One moment... this very minute. The fact is I've come to ask the hand of your daughter, Natalya Stepanovna, in marriage.\n\n![](_page_3_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nCHUBUKOV : [joyfully] By Jove! Ivan Vassilevitch! Say it again \u2014 I didn't hear it all!\n\n123\n\n- LOMOV : I have the honour to ask...\n- CHUBUKOV : [interrupting] My dear fellow... I'm so glad, and so on... Yes, indeed, and all that sort of thing. [Embraces and kisses Lomov] I've been hoping for it for a long time. It's been my continual desire. [Sheds a tear] And I've always loved you, my angel, as if you were my own son. May God give you both \u2014 His help and His love and so on, and so much hope... What am I behaving in this idiotic way for? I'm off my balance with joy, absolutely off my balance! Oh, with all my soul... I'll go and call Natasha, and all that.\n- LOMOV : [greatly moved] Honoured Stepan Stepanovitch, do you think I may count on her consent?\n- CHUBUKOV : Why, of course, my darling, and... as if she won't consent! She's in love; egad, she's like a lovesick cat, and so on. Shan't be long! [Exit.]\n- LOMOV : It's cold... I'm trembling all over, just as if I'd got an examination before me. The great thing is, I must have my mind made up. If I give myself time to think, to hesitate, to talk a lot, to look for an ideal, or for real love, then I'll never get married. Brr... It's cold! Natalya\n\nStepanovna is an excellent housekeeper, not bad-looking, well-educated. What more do I want? But I'm getting a noise in my ears from excitement. [Drinks] And it's impossible for me not to marry. In the first place, I'm already 35 \u2014 a critical age, so to speak. In the second place, I ought to lead a quiet and regular life. I suffer from palpitations, I'm excitable and always getting awfully upset; at this very moment my lips are trembling, and there's a twitch in my right eyebrow. But the very worst of all is the way I sleep. I no sooner get into bed and begin to go off, when suddenly something in my left side gives a pull, and I can feel it in my shoulder and head... I jump up like a lunatic, walk about a bit and lie down again, but as soon as I begin to get off to sleep there's another pull! And this may happen twenty times... [Natalya Stepanovna comes in.]\n\nNATLYA : Well, there! It's you, and papa said, \"Go; there's a merchant come for his goods.\" How do you do, Ivan Vassilevitch?\n\nLOMOV : How do you do, honoured Natalya Stepanovna?\n\nNATALYA : You must excuse my apron and neglige. We're shelling peas for drying. Why haven't you been here for such a long time? Sit down... [They seat themselves.] Won't you have some lunch?\n\nLOMOV : No, thank you, I've had some already.\n\nNATALYA : Then smoke. Here are the matches. The weather is splendid now, but yesterday it was so wet that the workmen didn't do anything all day. How much hay have you stacked? Just think, I felt greedy and had a whole field cut, and now I'm not at all pleased about it because I'm afraid my hay may rot. I ought to have waited a bit. But what's this? Why, you're in evening dress! Well, I never! Are you going to a ball or what? Though I must say you look better... Tell me, why are you got up like that?\n\nLOMOV : [excited] You see, honoured Natalya Stepanovna... the fact is, I've made up my mind to ask you to hear me out... Of course you'll be surprised and perhaps even angry, but a... [aside] It's awfully cold!\n\n- NATALYA : What's the matter? [pause] Well?\n- LOMOV : I shall try to be brief. You must know, honoured Natalya Stepanovna, that I have long, since my childhood, in fact,\n\nhad the privilege of knowing your family. My late aunt and her husband, from whom, as you know, I inherited my land, always had the greatest respect for your father and your late mother. The Lomovs and the Chubukovs have always had the most friendly, and I might almost say the most affectionate, regard for each other. And, as you know, my land is a near neighbour of yours. You will remember that my Oxen Meadows touch your birchwoods.\n\n- NATALYA : Excuse my interrupting you. You say, \"my Oxen Meadows\". But are they yours?\n- LOMOV : Yes, mine.\n- NATALYA : What are you talking about? Oxen Meadows are ours, not yours!\n- LOMOV : No, mine, honoured Natalya Stepanovna.\n- NATALYA : Well, I never knew that before. How do you make that out?\n- LOMOV : How? I'm speaking of those Oxen Meadows which are wedged in between your birchwoods and the Burnt Marsh.\n- NATALYA : Yes, yes... they're ours.\n- LOMOV : No, you're mistaken, honoured Natalya Stepanovna, they're mine.\n\n125\n\n- NATALYA : Just think, Ivan Vassilevitch! How long have they been yours?\n- LOMOV : How long? As long as I can remember.\n- NATALYA : Really, you won't get me to believe that!\n- LOMOV : But you can see from the documents, honoured Natalya Stepanovna. Oxen Meadows, it's true, were once the subject of dispute, but now everybody knows that they are mine. There's nothing to argue about. You see my aunt's grandmother gave the free use of these Meadows in perpetuity to the peasants of your father's grandfather, in return for which they were to make bricks for her. The peasants belonging to your father's grandfather had the free use of the Meadows for forty years, and had got into the habit of regarding them as their own, when it happened that...\n- NATALYA : No, it isn't at all like that! Both grandfather and greatgrandfather reckoned that their land extended to Burnt Marsh \u2014 which means that Oxen Meadows were ours. I don't see what there is to argue about. It's simply silly!\n\nLOMOV : I'll show you the documents, Natalya Stepanovna!\n\n- NATALYA : No, you're simply joking, or making fun of me. What a surprise! We've had the land for nearly three hundred years, and then we're suddenly told that it isn't ours! Ivan Vassilevitch, I can hardly believe my own ears. These Meadows aren't worth much to me. They only come to five dessiatins, and are worth perhaps 300 roubles, but I can't stand unfairness. Say what you will, I can't stand unfairness.\n- LOMOV : Hear me out, I implore you! The peasants of your father's grandfather, as I have already had the honour of explaining to you, used to bake bricks for my aunt's grandmother. Now my aunt's grandmother, wishing to make them a pleasant...\n\nNATALYA : I can't make head or tail of all this about aunts and grandfathers and grandmothers. The Meadows are ours, that's all.\n\nLOMOV : Mine.\n\n126First Flight\n\n- NATALYA : Ours! You can go on proving it for two days on end, you can go and put on fifteen dress jackets, but I tell you they're ours, ours, ours! I don't want anything of yours and I don't want to give anything of mine. So there!\n- LOMOV : Natalya Stepanovna, I don't want the Meadows, but I am acting on principle. If you like, I'll make you a present of them.\n- NATALYA : I can make you a present of them myself, because they're mine! Your behaviour, Ivan Vassilevitch, is strange, to say the least! Up to this we have always thought of you as a good neighbour, a friend; last year we lent you our threshing-machine, although on that account we had to put off our own threshing till November, but you behave to us as if we were gypsies. Giving me my own land, indeed! No, really, that's not at all neighbourly! In my opinion, it's even impudent, if you want to know.\n\nLOMOV : Then you make out that I'm a landgrabber? Madam, never in my life have I grabbed anybody else's land and I shan't allow anybody to accuse me of having done so. [Quickly steps to the carafe and drinks more water] Oxen Meadows are mine!\n\nNATALYA : It's not true, they're ours!\n\nLOMOV : Mine!\n\n| \u043dt<br>\u043ft |\n|----------|\n|----------|\n\n| : | It's not true!

Do be a reasonable man! My aunt's grandmother gave the Meadows for the temporary and free use of your grandfather's peasants. The peasants used the land for forty years and got accustomed to it as if it was their own, when it happened that...\n- CHUBUKOV : Excuse me, my precious.

You won't prove anything just by yelling. I don't want anything of yours, and don't intend to give up what I have. Why should I? And you know, my beloved, that if you propose to go on arguing about it, I'd much sooner give up the Meadows to the peasants than to you. There!\n\nLOMOV : I don't understand! How have you the right to give away somebody else's property?\n\nCHUBUKOV : You may take it that I know whether I have the right or not. Because, young man, I'm not used to being spoken to in that tone of voice, and so on. I, young man, am twice your age, and ask you to speak to me without agitating yourself, and all that.\n\n128First Flight\n\nLOMOV : No, you just think I'm a fool and want to have me on! You call my land yours, and then you want me to talk to you calmly and politely! Good neighbours don't behave like that, Stepan Stepanovitch! You're not a neighbour, you're a grabber!\n\nCHUBUKOV : What's that?

Oh, have you heard? Just think, what a misfortune I've had! My dog Guess, who you know, has gone lame.\n\nNATALYA : What a pity! Why?\n\n- LOMOV : I don't know. Must have got his leg twisted or bitten by some other dog. [sighs] My very best dog, to say nothing of the expense. I gave Mironov 125 roubles for him.\n- NATALYA : It was too much, Ivan Vassilevitch.\n- LOMOV : I think it was very cheap. He's a first-rate dog.\n- NATALYA : Papa gave 85 roubles for his Squeezer, and Squeezer is heaps better than Guess!\n- LOMOV : Squeezer better than Guess? What an idea! [laughs] Squeezer better than Guess!\n- NATALYA : Of course he's better! Of course, Squeezer is young, he may develop a bit, but on points and pedigree he's better than anything that even Volchanetsky has got.\n- LOMOV : Excuse me, Natalya Stepanovna, but you forget that he is overshot, and an overshot always means the dog is a bad hunter!\n- NATALYA : Overshot, is he? The first time I hear it!\n\nLOMOV : I assure you that his lower jaw is shorter than the upper.\n\nNATALYA : Have you measured?\n\n- LOMOV : Yes. He's all right at following, of course, but if you want to get hold of anything...\n- NATALYA : In the first place, our Squeezer is a thoroughbred animal, the son of Harness and Chisels while there's no getting at the pedigree of your dog at all. He's old and as ugly as a worn-out cab-horse.\n- LOMOV : He is old, but I wouldn't take five Squeezers for him. Why, how can you? Guess is a dog; as for Squeezer, well, it's too funny to argue. Anybody you like has a dog as good as Squeezer... you may find them under every bush almost. Twenty-five roubles would be a handsome price to pay for him.\n- NATALYA : There's some demon of contradition in you today, Ivan Vassilevitch. First you pretend that the Meadows are yours; now, that Guess is better than Squeezer. I don't like people who don't say what they mean, because you know perfectly well that Squeezer is a hundred times better than your silly Guess. Why do you want to say he isn't?\n\n| LOMOV    | : | I see, Natalya Stepanovna, that you consider me either<br>blind or a fool.

(For example, Lomov in the end calls Chubukov an intriguer; but earlier, Chubukov has himself called Lomov a \"malicious, doublefaced intriguer.\" Again, Lomov begins by describing Natalya as \"an excellent housekeeper, not bad-looking, well-educated.\")\n  - (ii) Then think of five adjectives or adjectival expressions of your own to describe each character in the play.\n  - (iii) Can you now imagine what these characters will quarrel about next?\n\nI. 1.

Reported Speech\n\nA sentence in reported speech consists of two parts: a reporting clause, which contains the reporting verb, and the reported clause. Look at the following sentences.\n\n- (a) \"I went to visit my grandma last week,\" said Mamta.\n- (b) Mamta said that she had gone to visit her grandma the previous week.\n\nIn sentence (a), we have Mamta's exact words. This is an example of direct speech. In sentence (b), someone is reporting what Mamta said. This is called indirect speech or reported speech. A sentence in reported speech is made up of two parts \u2014 a reporting clause and a reported clause.\n\nIn sentence (b), Mamta said is the reporting clause containing the reporting verb said. The other clause \u2014 that she had gone to visit her grandma last week \u2014 is the reported clause.\n\nNotice that in sentence (b) we put the reporting clause first. This is done to show that we are not speaking directly, but reporting someone else's words. The tense of the verb also changes; past tense (went) becomes past perfect (had gone).\n\nHere are some pairs of sentences in direct and reported speech. Read them carefully, and do the task that follows:\n\n- 1. (i) LOMOV : Honoured Stepan Stepanovitch, do you think I may count on her consent? (Direct Speech)\n  - (ii) Lomov asked Stepan Stepanovitch respectfully if he thought he might count on her consent. (Reported Speech)\n- 2. (i) LOMOV : I'm getting a noise in my ears from excitement. (Direct Speech)\n  - (ii) Lomov said that he was getting a noise in his ears from excitement. (Reported Speech)\n- 3. (i) NATALYA : Why haven't you been here for such a long time? (Direct Speech)\n  - (ii) Natalya Stepanovna asked why he hadn't been there for such a long time. (Reported Speech)\n- 4. (i) CHUBUKOV : What's the matter? (Direct Speech)\n  - (ii) Chubukov asked him what the matter was. (Reported Speech)\n- 5. (i) NATALYA : My mowers will be there this very day! (Direct Speech)\n  - (ii) Natalya Stepanovna declared that her mowers would be there that very day. (Reported Speech)\n\nYou must have noticed that when we report someone's exact words, we have to make some changes in the sentence structure. In the following sentences fill in the blanks to list the changes that have occurred in the above pairs of sentences. One has been done for you.\n\n- 1. To report a question, we use the reporting verb (as in Sentence Set 1). asked\n- 2. To report a statement, we use the reporting verb .\n- 3. The adverb of place here changes to .\n- 4. When the verb in direct speech is in the present tense, the verb in reported speech is in the tense (as in Sentence Set 3).\n- 5. If the verb in direct speech is in the present continuous tense, the verb in reported speech changes to tense. For example, changes to was getting.\n- 6. When the sentence in direct speech contains a word denoting respect, we add the adverb in the reporting clause (as in Sentence Set 1).\n- 7. The pronouns I, me, our and mine, which are used in the first person in direct speech, change according to the subject or object of the reporting verb such as , , or in reported speech.\n- III. Here is an excerpt from an article from the Times of India dated 27 August 2006. Rewrite it, changing the sentences in direct speech into reported speech. Leave the other sentences unchanged.\n\n\"Why do you want to know my age? If people know I am so old, I won't get work!\" laughs 90-year-old A. K. Hangal, one of Hindi cinema's most famous character actors. For his age, he is rather energetic. \"What's the secret?\" we ask. \"My intake of everything is in small quantities. And I walk a lot,\" he replies. \"I joined the industry when people retire. I was in my 40s. So I don't miss being called a star. I am still respected and given work, when actors of my age are living in poverty and without work. I don't have any complaints,\" he says, adding, \"but yes, I have always been underpaid.\" Recipient of the Padma Bhushan, Hangal never hankered after money or materialistic gains. \"No doubt I am content today, but money is important. I was a fool not to understand the value of money earlier,\" he regrets.\n\n137\n\n- 1. Anger Management: As adults, one important thing to learn is how to manage our temper. Some of us tend to get angry quickly, while others remain calm. Can you think of three ill effects that result from anger? Note them down. Suggest ways to avoid losing your temper in such situations. Are there any benefits from anger?\n- 2. In pairs, prepare a script based on the given excerpt from The Home and the World by Rabindranath Tagore. You may write five exchanges between the characters with other directions such as movements on stage and way of speaking, etc.\n\nOne afternoon, when I happened to be specially busy, word came to my office room that Bimala had sent for me. I was startled.\n\n\"Who did you say had sent for me?\" I asked the messenger.\n\n\"The Rani Mother\".\n\n\"The Bara Rani?\"\n\n\"No, sir, the Chota Rani Mother.\"\n\nThe Chota Rani! It seemed a century since I had been sent for by her. I kept them all waiting there, and went off into the inner apartments. When I stepped into our room I had another shock of surprise to find Bimala there with a distinct suggestion of being dressed up. The room, which from persistent neglect, had latterly acquired an air of having grown absent-minded, had regained something of its old order this afternoon. I stood there silently, looking enquiringly at Bimala.\n\nShe flushed a little and the fingers of her right hand toyed for a time with the bangles on her left arm. Then she abruptly broke the silence. \"Look here! Is it right that ours should be the only market in all Bengal which allows foreign goods?\"\n\n\"What, then, would be the right thing to do?\" I asked.\n\n\"Order them to be cleared out!\"\n\n\"But the goods are not mine.\"\n\n\"Is not the market yours?\"\n\n\"It is much more theirs who use it for trade.\"\n\n\"Let them trade in Indian goods, then.\"\n\n\"Nothing would please me better. But suppose they do not?\"\n\n\"Nonsense! How dare they be so insolent? Are you not\u2026\"\n\n\"I am very busy this afternoon and cannot stop to argue it out. But I must refuse to tyrannise.\"\n\n\"It would not be tyranny for selfish gain, but for the sake of the country.\"\n\n\"To tyrannise for the country is to tyrannise over the country. But that I am afraid you will never understand.\" With this I came away.\n\n- 3. In groups, discuss the qualities one should look for in a marriage partner.

Students should then guess the name of the playwright.\n\n (1564 \u20131616). He was born at Stratford-on-Avon in April 1564. His father was an important public figure in Stratford. People believe that he received a decent grammar-school education in literature, logic, and Latin (mathematics and natural science did not form part of the curriculum). When he was eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway, who was eight years his senior. He seems to have prospered in the London theatre world. He probably began his career as an actor in London, and he earned enough as author to acquire landed property.\n\nWhen he was forty-seven, he retired to a large house in Stratford. He died in 1616, leaving behind a body of work that still stands as a pinnacle in world literature.\n\n#### Homophones\n\n139\n\nThe Proposal\n\nCan you find the words below that are spelt similarly, and sometimes even pronounced similarly, but have very different meanings?

                "answer": "The correct answer is (iii) the act of asking someone's hand in marriage. This is evident from the play's content where Ivan Lomov comes to ask for Natalya's hand in marriage from her father Chubukov. The entire play revolves around this marriage proposal, though it gets complicated by various arguments between the characters. The title 'The Proposal' specifically refers to a marriage proposal, which was the original purpose of Lomov's visit to the Chubukov household."

                "answer": "Chubukov initially suspects that Lomov has come to borrow money. This is clear from his aside: '[aside] He's come to borrow money. Shan't give him any!' However, when he learns that Lomov wants to propose to Natalya, his attitude completely changes.\n\nChubukov is not entirely sincere when he says he's always loved Lomov like a son. Evidence for this includes:\n1. His immediate suspicion about borrowing money shows he doesn't trust Lomov\n2. During the arguments, he hurls insults at Lomov, calling him names like 'pettifogger,' 'intriguer,' and mentions negative things about Lomov's family\n3. His dramatic change in behavior suggests his affection is more about the advantageous marriage alliance than genuine love\n4. He's primarily motivated by economic interests - the play mentions wealthy families seeking ties with other wealthy families to increase their estates\n\nHis 'love' appears to be conditional and based on social and economic benefits rather than genuine affection."

                "answer": "Chubukov's assessment appears to be incorrect based on Natalya's behavior in the play. Evidence against her being 'in love':\n\n1. She doesn't know about the proposal until after Lomov leaves, showing no romantic awareness\n2. She immediately gets into heated arguments with Lomov about property and dogs, showing no romantic interest\n3. Her distress when she learns about the proposal seems more about missing a marriage opportunity than losing someone she loves\n4. She's described as 25 years old, which was considered quite old for marriage in that era, suggesting desperation rather than love\n5. Her quick agreement to the marriage after learning about it suggests practical rather than romantic motives\n\nEvidence that might support some interest:\n1. Her immediate hysteria when she learns Lomov came to propose\n2. Her insistence on bringing him back\n3. Her willingness to apologize and agree about the meadows\n\nHowever, this behavior seems more indicative of not wanting to miss a marriage opportunity rather than being deeply in love.

What should be a simple proposal turns into a series of heated arguments between all three characters over petty issues like property ownership and the quality of their hunting dogs. The characters are more concerned with material possessions and winning arguments than with genuine relationships or love. Despite the constant quarreling and Lomov's repeated fainting spells, the marriage proposal is eventually accepted, driven by economic considerations rather than romance. The play satirizes the tendency of wealthy families to seek advantageous marriages for financial gain while highlighting the absurdly quarrelsome nature of the characters who continue arguing even after the engagement is settled."
