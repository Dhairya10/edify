Those eaters of loaves might have vanished but the makers are still there. We still have amongst us the mixers, the moulders and those who bake the loaves. Those age-old, timetested furnaces still exist. The fire in the furnaces has not yet been extinguished. The thud and jingle of\n\nreminiscing nostalgically thinking fondly of the past\n\nthe traditional baker's bamboo, heralding his arrival in the morning, can still be heard in some places. Maybe the father is not alive but the son still carries on the family profession. These bakers are, even today, known as pader in Goa.\n\nDuring our childhood in Goa, the baker used to be our friend, companion and guide. He used to come at least twice a day. Once, when he set out in the morning on his selling round, and then again, when he returned after emptying his huge basket. The jingling thud of his bamboo woke us up from sleep and we ran to meet and greet him. Why was it so? Was it for the love of the loaf? Not at all. The loaves were bought by some Paskine or Bastine, the maid-servant of the house! What we longed for were those bread-bangles which we chose carefully. Sometimes it was sweet bread of special make.\n\nThe baker made his musical entry on the scene with the 'jhang, jhang' sound of his specially made bamboo staff. One hand supported the basket on his head and the other banged the bamboo on the ground. He would greet the lady of the house with \"Good morning\" and then place his basket on the vertical bamboo. We kids would be pushed aside with a mild rebuke and the loaves would be delivered to the servant. But we would not give up. We would climb a bench or the parapet and peep into the basket, somehow. I can still recall the typical fragrance of those loaves. Loaves for the elders and the bangles for the children. Then we did not even care to brush our teeth or wash our mouths properly. And why should we? Who would take the trouble of plucking the mango-leaf for the toothbrush? And why was it necessary at all? The tiger never brushed his teeth. Hot tea could wash and clean up everything so nicely, after all!\n\n#### rebuke\n\nan expression of disapproval; a scolding\n\n#### fragrance scent\n\n## 1. What are the elders in Goa nostalgic about?\n\nFirst Flight\n\n64\n\n- 2. Is bread-making still popular in Goa? How do you know?\n- 3. What is the baker called?\n\nOral Comprehension Check\n\n4. When would the baker come everyday? Why did the children run to meet him?\n\n#### heralding announcing\n\nMarriage gifts are meaningless without the sweet bread known as the bol, just as a party or a feast loses its charm without bread. Not enough can be said to show how important a baker can be for a village. The lady of the house must prepare sandwiches on the occasion of her daughter's engagement. Cakes and bolinhas are a must for Christmas as well as other festivals. Thus, the presence of the baker's furnace in the village is absolutely essential.\n\nThe baker or bread-seller of those days had a peculiar dress known as the kabai. It was a singlepiece long frock reaching down to the knees. In our childhood we saw bakers wearing a shirt and trousers which were shorter than full-length ones and longer than half pants. Even today, anyone who wears a half pant which reaches just below the knees invites the comment that he is dressed like a pader!\n\nThe baker usually collected his bills at the end of the month. Monthly accounts used to be recorded on some wall in pencil. Baking was indeed a profitable profession in the old days. The baker and his family never starved. He, his family and his servants always looked happy and prosperous. Their plump physique was an open testimony to this. Even today any person with a jackfruit-like physical appearance is easily compared to a baker.\n\n### Oral Comprehension Check\n\n| 1. | Match the following.

Compare the piece from the text (on the left below) with the other piece on Goan bakers (on the right). What makes the two texts so different? Are the facts the same? Do both writers give you a picture of the baker?\n\nOur elders are often heard reminiscing nostalgically about those good old Portuguese days, the Portuguese and their famous loaves of bread. Those eaters of loaves might have vanished but the makers are still there. We still have amongst us the mixers, the moulders and those who bake the loaves. Those age-old, time-tested furnaces still exist. The fire in the furnaces had not yet been extinguished. The thud and the jingle of the traditional baker's bamboo, heralding his arrival in the morning, can still be heard in some places.\n\nMay be the father is not alive but the son still carries on the family profession.\n\nAfter Goa's liberation, people used to say nostalgically that the Portuguese bread vanished with the paders. But the paders have managed to survive because they have perfected the art of door-todoor delivery service. The paders pick up the knowledge of breadmaking from traditions in the family. The leavened, oven-baked bread is a gift of the Portuguese to India.\n\n> [Adapted from Nandakumar Kamat's 'The Unsung Lives of Goan Paders']\n\n2. Now find a travel brochure about a place you have visited. Look at the description in the brochure. Then write your own account, adding details from your own experience, to give the reader a picture of the place, rather than an impersonal, factual description.\n\n- 1. In groups, collect information on how bakeries bake bread now and how the process has changed over time.\n- 2. There are a number of craft-based professions which are dying out. Pick one of the crafts below. Make a group presentation to the class about the skills required, and the possible reasons for the decline of the craft.

This land of rolling hills is inhabited by a proud race of martial men, beautiful women and wild creatures.\n\nCoorg, or Kodagu, the smallest district of Karnataka, is home to evergreen rainforests, spices and coffee plantations. Evergreen rainforests cover thirty per cent of this district. During the monsoons, it pours enough to keep many visitors away. The season of joy commences from September and continues till March. The weather is perfect, with\n\nsome showers thrown in for good measure. The air breathes of invigorating coffee. Coffee estates and colonial bungalows stand tucked under tree canopies in prime corners.\n\nThe fiercely independent people of Coorg are possibly of Greek or Arabic descent. As one story goes, a part of Alexander's army moved south along the coast and settled here when return became impractical. These people married amongst the locals and their culture is apparent in the martial traditions, marriage and religious rites, which are distinct from the Hindu mainstream. The theory of Arab origin draws support\n\nfrom the long, black coat\n\n### drifted from\n\nbeen carried along gently by air\n\n### martial having to do with war\n\n### canopies\n\nroof-like coverings that form shelters\n\nprime here, best\n\nmainstream a tradition which\n\n![](_page_5_Picture_15.jpeg)\n\nFirst Flight\n\nTraditional Coorgi dress most people follow\n\nwith an embroidered waist-belt worn by the Kodavus. Known as kuppia, it resembles the kuffia worn by the Arabs and the Kurds.\n\nCoorgi homes have a tradition of hospitality, and they are more than willing to recount numerous tales of valour related to their sons and fathers. The Coorg Regiment is one of the most decorated in the Indian Army, and the first Chief of the Indian Army, General Cariappa, was a Coorgi. Even now, Kodavus are the only people in India permitted to carry firearms without a licence.\n\nThe river, Kaveri, obtains its water from the hills and forests of Coorg. Mahaseer \u2014 a large freshwater fish \u2014 abound in these waters. Kingfishers dive for their catch, while squirrels and langurs drop partially eaten fruit for the mischief of enjoying the splash and the ripple effect in the clear water. Elephants enjoy being bathed and scrubbed in the river by their mahouts.\n\nThe most laidback individuals become converts to the life of high-energy adventure with river rafting, canoeing, rappelling, rock climbing and mountain\n\n#### tales of valour\n\nstories of courage and bravery, usually in war\n\n#### most decorated\n\nhaving received the maximum number of awards for bravery in war\n\n#### laidback\n\nrelaxed; not in a hurry\n\n#### rafting\n\ntravelling in a river in a raft ( a floating platform made by tying planks together)\n\n#### canoeing\n\ntravelling in a river in a canoe (a large, narrow boat)\n\n#### rappelling\n\ngoing down a cliff by sliding down a rope\n\nGlimpses of India\n\n69\n\nBasket-seller from Coorg\n\nbiking.

I do, however, prefer to step aside for wild elephants.\n\nThe climb to the Brahmagiri hills brings you into a panoramic view of the entire misty landscape of Coorg. A walk across the rope bridge leads to the sixty-four-acre island of Nisargadhama. Running into Buddhist monks from India's largest Tibetan settlement, at nearby Bylakuppe, is a bonus. The monks, in red, ochre and yellow robes, are amongst the many surprises that wait to be discovered by visitors searching for the heart and soul of India, right here in Coorg.\n\n#### trails\n\npaths created by walking\n\npanoramic view a view of a wide area of land\n\n#### FACT FILE\n\nFirst Flight\n\n70\n\n### How to Reach\n\nMadikeri, the district headquarters, is the only gateway to Coorg.

Pranjol's father is the manager of a tea-garden in Upper Assam and Pranjol has invited Rajvir to visit his home during the summer vacation.\n\n\"CHAI-GARAM... garam-chai,\" a vendor called out in a high-pitched voice.\n\nHe came up to their window and asked,\"Chai, sa'ab?\" \"Give us two cups,\" Pranjol said.\n\nThey sipped the steaming hot liquid. Almost everyone in their compartment was drinking tea too.\n\n\"Do you know that over eighty crore cups of tea are drunk every day throughout the world?\" Rajvir said.\n\n\"Whew!\" exclaimed Pranjol. \"Tea really is very popular.\"\n\nThe train pulled out of the station. Pranjol buried his nose in his detective book again. Rajvir too was an ardent fan of detective stories, but at the moment he was keener on looking at the beautiful scenery.\n\nIt was green, green everywhere. Rajvir had never seen so much greenery before. Then the soft green paddy fields gave way to tea bushes.\n\nIt was a magnificent view. Against the backdrop of densely wooded hills a sea of tea bushes stretched as far as the eye could see. Dwarfing the tiny tea plants were tall sturdy shade-trees and amidst the orderly rows of bushes busily moved doll-like figures.\n\nFirst Flight\n\nIn the distance was an ugly building with smoke billowing out of tall chimneys.\n\n\"Hey, a tea garden!\" Rajvir cried excitedly.\n\nPranjol, who had been born and brought up on a plantation, didn't share Rajvir's excitement.\n\n\"Oh, this is tea country now,\" he said. \"Assam has the largest concentration of plantations in the world. You will see enough gardens to last you a lifetime!\"\n\n\"I have been reading as much as I could about tea,\" Rajvir said. \"No one really knows who discovered tea but there are many legends.\"\n\n\"What legends?\"\n\n\"Well, there's the one about the Chinese emperor who always boiled water before drinking it. One day a few leaves of the twigs burning under the pot fell into the water giving it a delicious flavour. It is said they were tea leaves.\"\n\n\"Tell me another!\" scoffed Pranjol.\n\n\"We have an Indian legend too. Bodhidharma, an ancient Buddhist ascetic, cut off his eyelids because he felt sleepy during meditations. Ten tea plants grew out of the eyelids. The leaves of these plants when put in hot water and drunk banished sleep.\n\n\"Tea was first drunk in China,\" Rajvir added, \"as far back as 2700 B.C.! In fact words such as tea, 'chai' and 'chini' are from Chinese. Tea came to Europe only in the sixteenth century and was drunk more as medicine than as beverage.\"\n\nThe train clattered into Mariani junction. The boys collected their luggage and pushed their way to the crowded platform.\n\nPranjol's parents were waiting for them.\n\nSoon they were driving towards Dhekiabari, the tea-garden managed by Pranjol's father .\n\nAn hour later the car veered sharply off the main road. They crossed a cattle-bridge and entered Dhekiabari Tea Estate.\n\nOn both sides of the gravel-road were acre upon acre of tea bushes, all neatly pruned to the same height. Groups of tea-pluckers, with bamboo baskets on their backs, wearing plastic aprons, were plucking the newly sprouted leaves.\n\nPranjol's father slowed down to allow a tractor, pulling a trailer-load of tea leaves, to pass.\n\n\"This is the second-flush or sprouting period, isn't it, Mr Barua?\" Rajvir asked. \"It lasts from May to July and yields the best tea.\"\n\n\"You seem to have done your homework before coming,\" Pranjol's father said in surprise.\n\n\"Yes, Mr Barua,\" Rajvir admitted. \"But I hope to learn much more while I'm here.\"\n\nFirst Flight\n\n74\n\nI. 1. Look at these words: upkeep, downpour, undergo, dropout, walk-in. They are built up from a verb (keep, pour, go, drop, walk) and an adverb or a particle (up, down, under, out, in).\n\n### Use these words appropriately in the sentences below. You may consult a dictionary.\n\n- (i) A heavy has been forecast due to low pressure in the Bay of Bengal.\n- (ii) Rakesh will major surgery tomorrow morning.\n- (iii) My brother is responsible for the of our family property.\n- (iv) The rate for this accountancy course is very high.\n- (v) She went to the Enterprise Company to attend a interview.\n- 2. Now fill in the blanks in the sentences given below by combining the verb given in brackets with one of the words from the box as appropriate.\n\nover by through out up down\n\n- (i) The Army attempted unsuccessfully to the Government. (throw)\n- (ii) Scientists are on the brink of a major in cancer research. (break)\n- (iii) The State Government plans to build a for Bhubaneswar to speed up traffic on the main highway. (pass)\n- (iv) Gautama's on life changed when he realised that the world is full of sorrow. (look)\n- (v) Rakesh seemed unusually after the game. (cast)\n\n- II. Notice how these -ing and -ed adjectives are used.\n  - (a) Chess is an interesting game. I am very interested in chess.\n  - (b) Going trekking in the Himalayas We are very excited about the this summer is an exciting idea. trek.\n\n(c) Are all your school books this He was bored as he had no boring? friends there.\n\nGlimpses of India\n\n75\n\nThe -ing adjectives show the qualities that chess, trekking, or these books have: they cause interest, excitement, or boredom in you. The \u2014ed/\u2014en adjectives show your mental state, or your physical state: how you feel in response to ideas, events or things.\n\n1. Think of suitable -ing or -ed adjectives to answer the following questions. You may also use words from those given above.\n\nHow would you describe\n\n- (i) a good detective serial on television?\n- (ii) a debate on your favourite topic 'Homework Should Be Banned'?\n- (iii) how you feel when you stay indoors due to incessant rain?\n- (iv) how you feel when you open a present?\n- (v) how you feel when you watch your favourite programme on television?\n- (vi) the look on your mother's face as you waited in a queue?\n- (vii) how you feel when tracking a tiger in a tiger reserve forest?\n- (viii) the story you have recently read, or a film you have seen?\n- 2. Now use the adjectives in the exercise above, as appropriate, to write a paragraph about Coorg.\n\n1. Read the following passage about tea.\n\nIndia and tea are so intertwined together that life without the brew is unimaginable. Tea entered our life only in the mid-nineteenth century when the British started plantations in Assam and Darjeeling! In the beginning though, Indians shunned the drink as they thought it was a poison that led to umpteen diseases. Ironically, tea colonised Britain where it became a part of their social diary and also led to the establishment of numerous tea houses.\n\nToday, scientific research across the world has attempted to establish the beneficial qualities of tea \u2014 a fact the Japanese and the Chinese knew anyway from ancient times, attributing to it numerous medicinal properties.\n\n### [Source: 'History: Tea Anytime' by Ranjit Biswas from Literary Review, The Hindu, 1 October 2006]\n\nCollect information about tea, e.g. its evolution as a drink, its beneficial qualities. You can consult an encyclopedia or visit Internet websites. Then form groups of five and play the following roles: Imagine a meeting of a tea planter, a sales agent, a tea lover (consumer), a physician and a tea-shop owner. Each person in the group has to put forward his/her views about tea. You may use the following words and phrases.\n\n- I disagree with you ... I think that tea ...\n- I would like you to know ... I agree with ...\n- It is my feeling ... I suggest ...\n- May I know why you ... I am afraid ...\n- I feel ... It is important to know ...\n- 2. You are the sales executive of a famous tea company and you have been asked to draft an advertisement for the product. Draft the advertisement using the information you collected for the role play. You can draw pictures or add photographs and make your advertisement colourful.\n\n### WHAT WE HAVE DONE\n\nGiven a picture of three different regions of India, giving an idea of how varied and charming and beautiful our country is.\n\n### WHAT YOU CAN D<sup>O</sup>\n\nGet your students to arrange an exhibition of photographs of different places in India \u2014 good sources are travel articles in Sunday newspapers, or in travel magazines, or in brochures available at travel agents. Ask students to bring in two or three pictures each, accompanied by a short, neatly hand-written write-up on the place shown in the pictures. Arrange them on your classroom walls. Let the students study them. They can then discuss, and later vote on the place they would most like to see.\n\n# The Trees\n\nCan there be a forest without trees? Where are the trees in this poem, and where do they go?\n\nThe trees inside are moving out into the forest, the forest that was empty all these days where no bird could sit no insect hide no sun bury its feet in shadow the forest that was empty all these nights will be full of trees by morning.\n\nAll night the roots work to disengage themselves from the cracks in the veranda floor. The leaves strain toward the glass small twigs stiff with exertion long-cramped boughs shuffling under the roof like newly discharged patients half-dazed, moving to the clinic doors.\n\nI sit inside, doors open to the veranda writing long letters in which I scarcely mention the departure of the forest from the house. The night is fresh, the whole moon shines in a sky still open the smell of leaves and lichen still reaches like a voice into the rooms.\n\nMy head is full of whispers which tomorrow will be silent. Listen. The glass is breaking. The trees are stumbling forward into the night. Winds rush to meet them. The moon is broken like a mirror, its pieces flash now in the crown of the tallest oak.\n\n# ADRIENNE RICH\n\nAdrienne Rich was born in Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.A. in 1929. She is the author of nearly twenty volumes of poetry, and has been called a feminist and a radical poet.\n\nFirst Flight\n\n78\n\nto disengage themselves: to separate themselves\n\nstrain: make efforts to move\n\nbough: branch\n\nshuffling: moving repeatedly from one position to another\n\nlichen: crusty patches or bushy growth on tree trunks/bare ground formed by association of fungus and alga.\n\n- 1. (i) Find, in the first stanza, three things that cannot happen in a treeless forest.\n  - (ii) What picture do these words create in your mind: \"\u2026 sun bury its feet in shadow\u2026\"? What could the poet mean by the sun's 'feet'?\n- 2. (i) Where are the trees in the poem? What do their roots, their leaves, and their twigs do?\n  - (ii) What does the poet compare their branches to?\n- 3. (i) How does the poet describe the moon: (a) at the beginning of the third stanza, and (b) at its end? What causes this change?\n  - (ii) What happens to the house when the trees move out of it?\n  - (iii) Why do you think the poet does not mention \"the departure of the forest from the house\" in her letters? (Could it be that we are often silent about important happenings that are so unexpected that they embarrass us? Think about this again when you answer the next set of questions.)\n\n- 4. Now that you have read the poem in detail, we can begin to ask what the poem might mean. Here are two suggestions. Can you think of others?\n  - (i) Does the poem present a conflict between man and nature? Compare it with A Tiger in the Zoo. Is the poet suggesting that plants and trees, used for 'interior decoration' in cities while forests are cut down, are 'imprisoned', and need to 'break out'?\n  - (ii) On the other hand, Adrienne Rich has been known to use trees as a metaphor for human beings; this is a recurrent image in her poetry. What new meanings emerge from the poem if you take its trees to be symbolic of this particular meaning?\n- 5. You may read the poem 'On Killing a Tree' by Gieve Patel (Beehive Textbook in English for Class IX, NCERT). Compare and contrast it with the poem you have just read.\n\n### Homophones\n\nCan you find the words below that are spelt similarly, and sometimes even pronounced similarly, but have very different meanings?

Children ran to meet him not for the regular loaves (which were bought by the maid-servants), but because they longed for the bread-bangles and sometimes sweet bread of special make that the baker carried for them."

This is because the traditional dress of bakers (paders) included trousers that were shorter than full-length but longer than half pants, creating this distinctive length that became associated with the pader's appearance."

Just as a jackfruit is large and bulky, this phrase describes someone who is pleasantly fat or has a robust physique. The text suggests that bakers typically had this appearance because their profession was profitable and they never starved, indicating their prosperity and good health."

We know this because: bread is essential for all major occasions (marriages, parties, festivals), marriage gifts are meaningless without sweet bread (bol), parties lose charm without bread, sandwiches are a must for engagements, cakes and bolinhas are required for Christmas and festivals, and the text states 'not enough can be said to show how important a baker can be for a village.'"

What the pader wore: Shirt and trousers shorter than full-length but longer than half pants. When the pader was paid: At the end of the month, with accounts recorded on walls in pencil.

These people married locals, and their culture is apparent in martial traditions and religious rites distinct from Hindu mainstream. (2) Arabic origin - Supported by the long black coat with embroidered waist-belt (kuppia) worn by Kodavus, which resembles the kuffia worn by Arabs and Kurds."

The phrase 'sun bury its feet in shadow' creates a personified image where the sun is given human characteristics.

Their roots work all night to disengage themselves from cracks in the veranda floor, their leaves strain toward the glass, and small twigs are stiff with exertion.

At the end, 'The moon is broken like a mirror, its pieces flash now in the crown of the tallest oak.' The change is caused by the trees moving out and their branches/leaves breaking up the moonlight, creating a fragmented reflection. The trees' movement from inside to outside changes how the moonlight appears - from whole and clear to broken and scattered through the tree canopy."

If trees symbolize human beings, new meanings emerge: the poem could represent people breaking free from confinement (social, psychological, or physical), the need for humans to reconnect with nature, or individuals escaping from oppressive situations to find their true place. The 'departure' could symbolize liberation, self-discovery, or the human need for freedom and authentic existence."

The first section nostalgically describes the traditional Goan baker (pader) and the integral role of bread-making in Goan society, reflecting Portuguese colonial influence. The second section explores Coorg (Kodagu), Karnataka's smallest district, highlighting its coffee plantations, natural beauty, and the unique martial culture of the Kodavu people with their possibly Greek or Arabic origins. The final section follows two students traveling through Assam's tea country, revealing the legends and history of tea cultivation while showcasing the region's lush green landscapes. Together, these pieces illustrate how India's diverse regions maintain their distinct identities while contributing to the nation's collective cultural heritage, emphasizing themes of tradition, natural beauty, and the enduring influence of historical interactions with various cultures."
