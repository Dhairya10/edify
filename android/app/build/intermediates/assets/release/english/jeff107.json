Speak briefly about some of these scenes, or about other such scenes that you have seen; or write a sentence or two about them.\n\n| rivers         | green fields         | hills          |\n|----------------|----------------------|----------------|\n| roadside shops | market places        | railway tracks |\n| moving trains  | vehicles on the road | trees          |\n| a crowd        | clothes in shops     | animals        |\n|                |                      |                |\n\nTHERE was a girl named Valliammai who was called Valli for short. She was eight years old and very curious about things. Her favourite pastime was standing in the front doorway of her house, watching what was happening in the street outside. There were no playmates of her own age on her street, and this was about all she had to do.\n\nBut for Valli, standing at the front door was every bit as enjoyable as any of the elaborate games other children played. Watching the street gave her many new unusual experiences.\n\n![](_page_1_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\nMadam Rides the Bus\n\nThe most fascinating thing of all was the bus that travelled between her village and the nearest town. It passed through her street each hour, once going to the town and once coming back. The sight of the bus, filled each time with a new set of passengers, was a source of unending joy for Valli.\n\nDay after day she watched the bus, and gradually a tiny wish crept into her head and grew there: she wanted to ride on that bus, even if just once. This wish became stronger and stronger, until it was an overwhelming desire. Valli would stare wistfully at the people who got on or off the bus when it stopped at the street corner. Their faces would kindle in her longings, dreams, and hopes. If one of her friends happened to ride the bus and tried to describe the sights of the town to her, Valli would be too jealous to listen and would shout, in English: \"Proud! proud!\" Neither she nor her friends really understood the meaning of the word, but they used it often as a slang expression of disapproval.\n\nFirst Flight\n\n96\n\nOver many days and months Valli listened carefully to conversations between her neighbours and people who regularly used the bus, and she also asked a few discreet questions here and there. This way she picked up various small details about the bus journey. The town was six miles from her village. The fare was thirty paise one way \u2014 \"which is almost nothing at all,\" she heard one well-dressed man say, but to Valli, who scarcely saw that much money from one month to the next, it seemed a fortune. The trip to the town took forty-five minutes. On reaching town, if she stayed in her seat and paid another thirty paise, she could return home on the same bus. This meant that she could take the one-o'clock afternoon bus, reach the town at one forty-five, and be back home by about two forty-five...\n\nOn and on went her thoughts as she calculated and recalculated, planned and replanned.\n\nwistfully longingly\n\nkindle set alight (a fire), here, feelings\n\na slang expression informal words, often used within a close group\n\ndiscreet questions careful questions\n\n### Oral Comprehension Check\n\n- 1. What was Valli's favourite pastime?\n- 2. What was a source of unending joy for Valli? What was her strongest desire?\n- 3. What did Valli find out about the bus journey? How did she find out these details?\n- 4. What do you think Valli was planning to do?\n  - I I\n\nWell, one fine spring day the afternoon bus was just on the point of leaving the village and turning into the main highway when a small voice was heard shouting: \"Stop the bus! Stop the bus!\" And a tiny hand was raised commandingly.\n\nThe bus slowed down to a crawl, and the conductor, sticking his head out the door, said, \"Hurry then! Tell whoever it is to come quickly.\"\n\n\"It's me,\" shouted Valli. \"I'm the one who has to get on.\"\n\nBy now the bus had come to a stop, and the conductor said, \"Oh, really! You don't say so!\"\n\n\"Yes, I simply have to go to town,\" said Valli, still standing outside the bus, \"and here's my money.\" She showed him some coins.\n\n\"Okay, okay, but first you must get on the bus,\" said the conductor, and he stretched out a hand to help her up.\n\n\"Never mind,\" she said, \"I can get on by myself. You don't have to help me.\"\n\nThe conductor was a jolly sort, fond of joking. \"Oh, please don't be angry with me, my fine madam,\" he said. \"Here, have a seat right up there in front. Everybody move aside please \u2014 make way for madam.\"\n\nIt was the slack time of day, and there were only six or seven passengers on the bus. They were all looking at Valli and laughing with the conductor. Valli was overcome with shyness. Avoiding everyone's eyes, she walked quickly to an empty seat and sat down.\n\nslack time a time when there is not much work\n\n![](_page_4_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n\"May we start now, madam?\" the conductor asked, smiling. Then he blew his whistle twice, and the bus moved forward with a roar.\n\nFirst Flight\n\n98\n\nIt was a new bus, its outside painted a gleaming white with some green stripes along the sides. Inside, the overhead bars shone like silver. Directly in front of Valli, above the windshield, there was a beautiful clock. The seats were soft and luxurious.\n\nValli devoured everything with her eyes. But when she started to look outside, she found her view cut off by a canvas blind that covered the lower part of her window. So she stood up on the seat and peered over the blind.\n\nThe bus was now going along the bank of a canal. The road was very narrow. On one side there was the canal and, beyond it, palm trees, grassland, distant mountains, and the blue, blue sky. On the other side was a deep ditch and then acres and acres of green fields \u2014 green, green, green, as far as the eye could see.\n\nOh, it was all so wonderful!\n\nSuddenly she was startled by a voice. \"Listen, child,\" said the voice, \"you shouldn't stand like that. Sit down.\"\n\nSitting down, she looked to see who had spoken. It was an elderly man who had honestly been concerned for her, but she was annoyed by his attention.\n\n\"There's nobody here who's a child,\" she said haughtily. \"I've paid my thirty paise like everyone else.\"\n\nThe conductor chimed in. \"Oh, sir, but this is a very grown-up madam. Do you think a mere girl could pay her own fare and travel to the city all alone?\"\n\nValli shot an angry glance at the conductor and said, \"I am not a madam. Please remember that. And you've not yet given me my ticket.\"\n\n\"I'll remember,\" the conductor said, mimicking her tone. Everyone laughed, and gradually Valli too joined in the laughter.\n\nThe conductor punched a ticket and handed it to her. \"Just sit back and make yourself comfortable. Why should you stand when you've paid for a seat?\"\n\n\"Because I want to,\" she answered, standing up again.\n\n\"But if you stand on the seat, you may fall and hurt yourself when the bus makes a sharp turn or hits a bump. That's why we want you to sit down, child.\"\n\n\"I'm not a child, I tell you,\" she said irritably. \"I'm eight years old.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course. How stupid of me! Eight years \u2014 my!\"\n\nThe bus stopped, some new passengers got on, and the conductor got busy for a time. Afraid of losing her seat, Valli finally sat down.\n\nAn elderly woman came and sat beside her. \"Are you all alone, dear?\" she asked Valli as the bus started again.\n\nValli found the woman absolutely repulsive \u2014 such big holes she had in her ear lobes, and such ugly earrings in them! And she could smell the betel nut the woman was chewing and see the betel juice that was threatening to spill over her lips at any moment.\n\nhaughtily proudly\n\nmimicking copying\n\nrepulsive causing strong\n\ndislike\n\nUgh! \u2014 who could be sociable with such a person?\n\n\"Yes, I'm travelling alone,\" she answered curtly. \"And I've got a ticket too.\"\n\n\"Yes, she's on her way to town,\" said the conductor. \"With a thirty-paise ticket.\"\n\n\"Oh, why don't you mind your own business,\" said Valli. But she laughed all the same, and the conductor laughed too.\n\nBut the old woman went on with her drivel. \"Is it proper for such a young person to travel alone? Do you know exactly where you're going in town? What's the street? What's the house number?\" drivel silly nonsense\n\n\"You needn't bother about me. I can take care of myself,\" Valli said, turning her face towards the window and staring out.\n\n### Oral Comprehension Check\n\nFirst Flight\n\n100\n\n- 1. Why does the conductor call Valli 'madam'?\n- 2. Why does Valli stand up on the seat? What does she see now?\n- 3. What does Valli tell the elderly man when he calls her a child?\n- 4. Why didn't Valli want to make friends with the elderly woman?\n\n# III\n\nHer first journey \u2014 what careful, painstaking, elaborate plans she had had to make for it! She had thriftily saved whatever stray coins came her way, resisting every temptation to buy peppermints, toys, balloons, and the like, and finally she had saved a total of sixty paise. How difficult it had been, particularly that day at the village fair, but she had resolutely stifled a strong desire to ride the merrygo-round, even though she had the money.\n\nAfter she had enough money saved, her next problem was how to slip out of the house without her mother's knowledge. But she managed this without too much difficulty. Every day after lunch her mother would nap from about one to four or so. Valli always used these hours for her 'excursions' as she stood looking from the doorway of her house\n\nthriftily\n\nspend money carefully\n\n### resolutely stifled\n\nsuppressed/ controlled with determination\n\ncurtly\n\nshowing displeasure\n\nor sometimes even ventured out into the village; today, these same hours could be used for her first excursion outside the village.\n\nThe bus rolled on now cutting across a bare landscape, now rushing through a tiny hamlet or past an odd wayside shop. Sometimes the bus seemed on the point of gobbling up another vehicle that was coming towards them or a pedestrian crossing the road. But lo! somehow it passed on smoothly, leaving all obstacles safely behind. Trees came running towards them but then stopped as the bus reached them and simply stood there helpless for a moment by the side of the road before rushing away in the other direction.\n\nSuddenly Valli clapped her hands with glee. A young cow, tail high in the air, was running very fast, right in the middle of the road, right in front of the bus. The bus slowed to a crawl, and the driver sounded his horn loudly again and again. But the more he honked, the more frightened the animal became and the faster it galloped \u2014 always right in front of the bus.\n\n![](_page_7_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\nventured out went cautiously, courageously\n\nMadam Rides the Bus\n\nSomehow this was very funny to Valli. She laughed and laughed until there were tears in her eyes.\n\n\"Hey, lady, haven't you laughed enough?\" called, the conductor. \"Better save some for tomorrow.\"\n\nAt last the cow moved off the road. And soon the bus came to a railroad crossing. A speck of a train could be seen in the distance, growing bigger and bigger as it drew near. Then it rushed past the crossing gate with a tremendous roar and rattle, shaking the bus. Then the bus went on and passed the train station. From there it traversed a busy, well-laid-out shopping street and, turning, entered a wider thoroughfare. Such big, bright-looking shops! What glittering displays of clothes and other merchandise! Such big crowds!\n\nthoroughfare a busy public road merchandise\n\nthings for sale\n\nStruck dumb with wonder, Valli gaped at everything.\n\nThen the bus stopped and everyone got off except Valli.\n\n \"Hey, lady,\" said the conductor, \"aren't you ready to get off? This is as far as your thirty paise takes you.\"\n\n\"No,\" Valli said, \"I'm going back on this same bus.\" She took another thirty paise from her pocket and handed the coins to the conductor.\n\n\"Why, is something the matter?\"\n\n\"No, nothing's the matter. I just felt like having a bus ride, that's all.\"\n\n\"Don't you want to have a look at the sights, now that you're here?\"\n\n\"All by myself? Oh, I'd be much too afraid.\"\n\nGreatly amused by the girl's way of speaking, the conductor said, \"But you weren't afraid to come in the bus.\"\n\n\"Nothing to be afraid of about that,\" she answered.\n\n\"Well, then, why not go to that stall over there and have something to drink? Nothing to be afraid of about that either.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, I couldn't do that.\"\n\n\"Well, then, let me bring you a cold drink.\"\n\nFirst Flight\n\n\"No, I don't have enough money. Just give me my ticket, that's all.\"\n\n\"It'll be my treat and not cost you anything.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" she said firmly, \"please, no.\"\n\nThe conductor shrugged, and they waited until it was time for the bus to begin the return journey. Again there weren't many passengers.\n\n### Oral Comprehension Check\n\n- 1. How did Valli save up money for her first journey? Was it easy for her?\n- 2.

But suddenly she saw a young cow lying dead by the roadside, just where it had been struck by some fast-moving vehicle.\n\n\"Isn't that the same cow that ran in front of the bus on our trip to town?\" she asked the conductor.\n\nThe conductor nodded, and she was overcome with sadness. What had been a lovable, beautiful creature just a little while ago had now suddenly lost its charm and its life and looked so horrible, so frightening as it lay there, legs spreadeagled, a fixed stare in its lifeless eyes, blood all over...\n\nThe bus moved on. The memory of the dead cow haunted her, dampening her enthusiasm. She no longer wanted to look out the window.\n\nShe sat thus, glued to her seat, until the bus reached her village at three forty. She stood up and\n\nspreadeagled spread out\n\n### haunted\n\nreturned repeatedly to her mind; was impossible to forget\n\nstretched herself. Then she turned to the conductor and said, \"Well, sir, 1 hope to see you again.\"\n\n\"Okay, madam,\" he answered her, smiling. \"Whenever you feel like a bus ride, come and join us. And don't forget to bring your fare.\"\n\nShe laughed and jumped down from the bus. Then away she went, running straight for home.\n\nWhen she entered her house she found her mother awake and talking to one of Valli's aunts, the one from South Street. This aunt was a real chatterbox, never closing her mouth once she started talking.\n\n\"And where have you been?\" said her aunt when Valli came in. She spoke very casually, not expecting a reply. So Valli just smiled, and her mother and aunt went on with their conversation.\n\n\"Yes, you're right,\" her mother said. \"So many things in our midst and in the world outside. How can we possibly know about everything? And even when we do know about something, we often can't understand it completely, can we?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" breathed Valli.\n\n\"What?\" asked her mother. \"What's that you say?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Valli, \"I was just agreeing with what you said about things happening without our knowledge.\"\n\n\"Just a chit of a girl, she is,\" said her aunt, \"and yet look how she pokes her nose into our conversation, just as though she were a grown lady.\"\n\nValli smiled to herself. She didn't want them to understand her smile. But, then, there wasn't much chance of that, was there?\n\n> [Translated from the Tamil by K. S. Sundaram Illustrated by R. K.

The students should be given two or three days to collect old (used) tickets from their friends, relatives and acquaintances: they could be bus tickets, train tickets, plane tickets, cinema tickets, tickets to cultural events, etc. By the time they finish the lesson they should be able to get a good collection in place. Get them to make a collage using as many as possible of the tickets collected, on a sheet of poster paper. This can then form the basis for many interesting activities: classification according to type of tickets (for what?) or price (how much?), etc; the most desirable tickets, the tickets no one wants, etc. \u2014 let students think of more ways to classify them. Get students to write a paragraph with the collage as base, and their imagination as guide.\n- 2. You can also ask the students do the following.\n  - (i) In the story Valli has to save money and make plans to be able to ride the bus. In pairs, discuss how you spent your pocket money last month. Did you spend it on yourself, or on someone dear to you?\n  - (ii) Valli's enthusiasm is dampened and the memory of the dead cow haunts her. In groups, discuss an incident which may have troubled or discouraged you.\n\n# The Tale of Custard the Dragon\n\nThis poem is written in the style of a ballad \u2014 a song or poem that tells a story. You must be familiar with ballads that narrate tales of courage or heroism. This poem is a humorous ballad close to a parody. Read it aloud, paying attention to the rhythm.\n\nBelinda lived in a little white house, With a little black kitten and a little grey mouse, And a little yellow dog and a little red wagon, And a realio, trulio, little pet dragon.\n\nNow the name of the little black kitten was Ink, And the little grey mouse, she called him Blink, And the little yellow dog was sharp as Mustard, But the dragon was a coward, and she called him Custard.\n\nCustard the dragon had big sharp teeth, And spikes on top of him and scales underneath, Mouth like a fireplace, chimney for a nose, And realio, trulio daggers on his toes.\n\nBelinda was as brave as a barrel full of bears, And Ink and Blink chased lions down the stairs, Mustard was as brave as a tiger in a rage, But Custard cried for a nice safe cage.\n\nBelinda tickled him, she tickled him unmerciful, Ink, Blink and Mustard, they rudely called him Percival, They all sat laughing in the little red wagon At the realio, trulio, cowardly dragon.\n\nBelinda giggled till she shook the house, And Blink said Weeck! which is giggling for a mouse, Ink and Mustard rudely asked his age, When Custard cried for a nice safe cage.\n\nSuddenly, suddenly they heard a nasty sound, And Mustard growled, and they all looked around. Meowch! cried Ink, and ooh! cried Belinda, For there was a pirate, climbing in the winda.\n\nPistol in his left hand, pistol in his right, And he held in his teeth a cutlass bright, His beard was black, one leg was wood; It was clear that the pirate meant no good.\n\nFirst Flight\n\n108\n\nBelinda paled, and she cried Help! Help! But Mustard fled with a terrified yelp, Ink trickled down to the bottom of the household, And little mouse Blink strategically mouseholed.\n\nBut up jumped Custard, snorting like an engine, Clashed his tail like irons in a dungeon, With a clatter and a clank and a jangling squirm, He went at the pirate like a robin at a worm.\n\nThe pirate gaped at Belinda's dragon, And gulped some grog from his pocket flagon, He fired two bullets, but they didn't hit, And Custard gobbled him, every bit.\n\nBelinda embraced him, Mustard licked him, No one mourned for his pirate victim. Ink and Blink in glee did gyrate Around the dragon that ate the pirate.\n\nBut presently up spoke little dog Mustard, I'd have been twice as brave if I hadn't been flustered. And up spoke Ink and up spoke Blink, We'd have been three times as brave, we think, And Custard said, I quite agree That everybody is braver than me.\n\nBelinda still lives in her little white house, With her little black kitten and her little grey mouse, And her little yellow dog and her little red wagon, And her realio, trulio little pet dragon.\n\nBelinda is as brave as a barrel full of bears, And Ink and Blink chase lions down the stairs, Mustard is as brave as a tiger in a rage, But Custard keeps crying for a nice safe cage.\n\nOGDEN NASH\n\nOgden Nash wrote over four hundred pieces of comic verse. The best of his work was published in 14 volumes between 1931 and 1972. His work is perhaps best described in this poetic tribute by Anthony Burgess:\n\n...he brought a new kind of sound to our literary diversions.\n\nAnd didn't care much about breaking the poetic laws of the Medes and the Persians.\n\nHe uses lines, sometimes of considerable length that are colloquial and prosy.\n\nAnd at the end presents you with a rhyme...\n\nThis bringing together of the informal and the formal is what his genius chiefly loves.\n\nI am trying to imitate him here, but he is probably quite inimitable.\n\nThe Tale of Custard the Dragon\n\ngrog: a drink typically drunk by sailors gyrate: to move around in circles\n\n- 1. Who are the characters in this poem? List them with their pet names.\n- 2. Why did Custard cry for a nice safe cage? Why is the dragon called \"cowardly dragon\"?\n- 3. \"Belinda tickled him, she tickled him unmerciful...\" Why?\n- 4. The poet has employed many poetic devices in the poem. For example: \"Clashed his tail like iron in a dungeon\" \u2014 the poetic device here is a simile. Can you, with your partner, list some more such poetic devices used in the poem?\n- 5. Read stanza three again to know how the poet describes the appearance of the dragon.\n- 6. Can you find out the rhyme scheme of two or three stanzas of the poem?\n- 7. Writers use words to give us a picture or image without actually saying what they mean. Can you trace some images used in the poem?\n- 8. Do you find The Tale of Custard the Dragon to be a serious or a light-hearted poem? Give reasons to support your answer.\n- 9. This poem, in ballad form, tells a story. Have you come across any such modern song or lyric that tells a story? If you know one, tell it to the class. Collect such songs as a project.\n\nHave fun writing your ballad. Gather information (choose/decide an idea/theme), organise your materials under characters and story and then write. Revise and edit your ballad to make it entertaining. Use the following guidelines to write your ballad.\n\n- Purpose of writing the ballad: to entertain and interest\n- To whom I am writing: decide for whom you are writing\n- How should I structure features?:\n  - Tell a simple narrative\n  - A few major characters\n  - A strong rhythm and rhyme\n  - May have a refrain (single or two line(s) repeated often)\n  - Divide into verses\n\nFirst Flight",
