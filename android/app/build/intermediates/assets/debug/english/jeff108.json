Who delivered it? Who do you think delivered a sermon at Benares?\n\nGAUTAMA Buddha (563 B.C. – 483 B.C.) began life as a prince named Siddhartha Gautama, in northern India. At twelve, he was sent away for schooling in the Hindu sacred scriptures and four years later he returned home to marry a princess. They had a son and lived for ten years as befitted royalty. At about the age of twenty-five, the Prince, heretofore shielded from the sufferings of the world, while out hunting chanced upon a sick man, then an aged man, then a funeral procession, and finally a monk begging for alms. These sights so moved him that he at once went out into the world to seek enlightenment concerning the sorrows he had witnessed. He wandered for seven years and finally sat down under a peepal tree, where he vowed to stay\n\nchanced upon came across by chance\n\nenlightenment a state of high spiritual knowledge until enlightenment came. Enlightened after seven days, he renamed the tree the Bodhi Tree (Tree of Wisdom) and began to teach and to share his new understandings. At that point he became known as the Buddha (the Awakened or the Enlightened). The Buddha preached his first sermon at the city of Benares, most holy of the dipping places on the River Ganges; that sermon has been preserved and is given here. It reflects the Buddha's wisdom about one inscrutable kind of suffering.\n\nKisa Gotami had an only son, and he died. In her grief she carried the dead child to all her neighbours, asking them for medicine, and the people said, \"She has lost her senses. The boy is dead.\"\n\nAt length, Kisa Gotami met a man who replied to her request, \"I cannot give thee medicine for thy child, but I know a physician who can.\"\n\nAnd the girl said, \"Pray tell me, sir; who is it?\" And the man replied, \"Go to Sakyamuni, the Buddha.\"\n\nKisa Gotami repaired to the Buddha and cried, \"Lord and Master, give me the medicine that will cure my boy.\"\n\nThe Buddha answered, \"I want a handful of mustardseed.\" And when the girl in her joy promised to procure it, the Buddha added, \"The mustard-seed must be taken from a house where no one has lost a child, husband, parent or friend.\"\n\nPoor Kisa Gotami now went from house to house, and the people pitied her and said, \"Here is mustardseed; take it!\" But when she asked, \"Did a son or daughter, a father or mother, die in your family?\" they answered her, \"Alas! the living are few, but the dead are many. Do not remind us of our deepest grief.\" And there was no house but some beloved one had died in it.\n\nKisa Gotami became weary and hopeless, and sat down at the wayside watching the lights of the city, as they flickered up and were extinguished again. At last the darkness of the night reigned everywhere. And she considered the fate of men, that their lives flicker up and are extinguished again. And she thought to herself, \"How selfish am I in my grief! Death is common to all; yet in this valley of desolation there is a path that leads him to immortality who has surrendered all selfishness.\"\n\nThe Buddha said, ''The life of mortals in this world is troubled and brief and combined with pain. For there\n\n## sermon\n\nreligious or moral talk\n\ndipping places bathing\n\n## inscrutable\n\nsomething which cannot be understood\n\n![](_page_1_Figure_14.jpeg)\n\nrepaired (a stylistic use) went to\n\n# valley of desolation an area which is filled with deep sorrow\n\nmortals those bound to die is not any means by which those that have been born can avoid dying; after reaching old age there is death; of such a nature are living beings. As ripe fruits are early in danger of falling, so mortals when born are always in danger of death. As all earthen vessels made by the potter end in being broken, so is the life of mortals. Both young and adult, both those who are fools and those who are wise, all fall into the power of death; all are subject to death.\n\n\"Of those who, overcome by death, depart from life, a father cannot save his son, nor kinsmen their relations. Mark! while relatives are looking on and lamenting deeply, one by one mortals are carried off, like an ox that is led to the slaughter. So the world is afflicted with death and decay, therefore the wise do not grieve, knowing the terms of the world.\n\n\"Not from weeping nor from grieving will anyone obtain peace of mind; on the contrary, his pain will be the greater and his body will suffer. He will make himself sick and pale, yet the dead are not saved by his lamentation. He who seeks peace should draw out the arrow of lamentation, and complaint, and grief. He who has drawn out the arrow and has become composed will obtain peace of mind; he who has overcome all sorrow will become free from sorrow, and be blessed.\"\n\n> [Source: Betty Renshaw Values and Voices: A College Reader (1975)]\n\nafflicted with affected by suffering, disease or pain\n\nlamentation expression of sorrow\n\n- 1. When her son dies, Kisa Gotami goes from house to house. What does she ask for? Does she get it? Why not?\n- 2. Kisa Gotami again goes from house to house after she speaks with the Buddha. What does she ask for, the second time around? Does she get it? Why not?\n- 3. What does Kisa Gotami understand the second time that she failed to understand the first time? Was this what the Buddha wanted her to understand?\n- 4. Why do you think Kisa Gotami understood this only the second time? In what way did the Buddha change her understanding?\n- 5. How do you usually understand the idea of 'selfishness'? Do you agree with Kisa Gotami that she was being 'selfish in her grief '?\n\nThe Sermon at Benares\n\n113\n\n- I. This text is written in an old-fashioned style, for it reports an incident more than two millennia old. Look for the following words and phrases in the text, and try to rephrase them in more current language, based on how you understand them.\n  - give thee medicine for thy child\n  - Pray tell me\n  - Kisa repaired to the Buddha\n  - there was no house but someone had died in it\n  - kinsmen\n  - Mark!\n- II. You know that we can combine sentences using words like and, or, but, yet and then. But sometimes no such word seems appropriate. In such a case we can use a semicolon (;) or a dash (—) to combine two clauses.\n\nShe has no interest in music; I doubt she will become a singer like her mother.\n\nThe second clause here gives the speaker's opinion on the first clause.\n\nHere is a sentence from the text that uses semicolons to combine clauses. Break up the sentence into three simple sentences. Can you then say which has a better rhythm when you read it, the single sentence using semicolons, or the three simple sentences?\n\nFor there is not any means by which those who have been born can avoid dying; after reaching old age there is death; of such a nature are living beings.\n\n114First Flight\n\nThe Buddha's sermon is over 2500 years old. Given below are two recent texts on the topic of grief. Read the texts, comparing them with each other and with the Buddha's sermon. Do you think the Buddha's ideas and way of teaching continue to hold meaning for us? Or have we found better ways to deal with grief? Discuss this in groups or in class.\n\n# I. A Guide to Coping with the Death of a Loved One\n\nMartha is having difficulty sleeping lately and no longer enjoys doing things with her friends. Martha lost her husband of 26 years to cancer a month ago.\n\nAnya, age 17, doesn't feel like eating and spends the days in her room crying. Her grandmother recently died.\n\nBoth of these individuals are experiencing grief. Grief is an emotion natural to all types of loss or significant change.\n\n# Feelings of Grief\n\nAlthough grief is unique and personal, a broad range of feelings and behaviours are commonly experienced after the death of a loved one.\n\n- Sadness. This is the most common, and it is not necessarily manifested by crying.\n- Anger. This is one of the most confusing feelings for a survivor. There may be frustration at not being able to prevent the death, and a sense of not being able to exist without the loved one.\n- Guilt and Self-reproach. People may believe that they were not kind enough or caring enough to the person who died, or that the person should have seen the doctor sooner.\n- Anxiety. An individual may fear that she/he won't be able to care for herself/himself.\n- Loneliness. There are reminders throughout the day that a partner, family member or friend is gone. For example, meals are no longer prepared the same way, phone calls to share a special moment don't happen.\n- Fatigue. There is an overall sense of feeling tired.\n- Disbelief: This occurs particularly if it was a sudden death.\n\n## Helping Others Who Are Experiencing Grief\n\nWhen a friend, loved one, or co-worker is experiencing grief—how can we help? It helps to understand that grief is expressed through a variety of behaviours.\n\nReach out to others in their grief, but understand that some may not want to accept help and will not share their grief. Others will want to talk about their thoughts and feelings or reminisce.\n\nBe patient and let the grieving person know that you care and are there to support him or her.\n\n# II. Good Grief\n\n# AMITAI ETZIONI\n\nSoon after my wife died — her car slid off an icy road in 1985 — a school psychologist warned me that my children and I were not mourning in the right way. We felt angry; the proper first stage, he said, is denial.\n\nIn late August this year, my 38-year-old son, Michael, died suddenly in his sleep, leaving behind a 2-year-old son and a wife expecting their next child.\n\nThere is no set form for grief, and no 'right' way to express it. There seems to be an expectation that, after a great loss, we will progress systematically through the well-known stages of grief. It is wrong, we are told, to jump to anger — or to wallow too long in this stage before moving towards acceptance.\n\n115\n\nBut I was, and am, angry. To make parents bury their children is wrong; to have both my wife and son taken from me, for forever and a day, is cruel beyond words.\n\nA relative from Jerusalem, who is a psychiatrist, brought some solace by citing the maxim: 'We are not to ask why, but what.' The 'what' is that which survivors in grief are bound to do for one another. Following that advice, my family, close friends and I keep busy, calling each other and giving long answers to simple questions like, \"How did your day go today?\" We try to avoid thinking about either the immediate past or the bereft future. We take turns playing with Max, Michael's two-year-old son. Friends spend nights with the young widow, and will be among those holding her hand when the baby is born.\n\nFocusing on what we do for one another is the only consolation we can find.\n\nWrite a page (about three paragraphs) on one of the following topics. You can think about the ideas in the text that are relevant to these topics, and add your own ideas and experiences to them.\n\n- 1. Teaching someone to understand a new or difficult idea\n- 2. Helping each other to get over difficult times\n- 3. Thinking about oneself as unique, or as one among billions of others\n\n## WHAT WE HAVE DONE\n\nNarrated the story of the Buddha, and the advice he gave to the grief-stricken woman.\n\n## WHAT YOU CAN D<sup>O</sup>\n\n1. Read and discuss the following extract from Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet with the students.\n\n## Joy and Sorrow\n\nThen a woman said, \"Speak to us of Joy and Sorrow.\"\n\nAnd he answered:\n\nYour joy is your sorrow unmasked.\n\nAnd the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.\n\nAnd how else can it be?\n\nThe deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.\n\nIs not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter's oven?\n\nAnd is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed out with knives?\n\nWhen you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.\n\nWhen you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.\n\nSome of you say, \"Joy is greater than sorrow,\" and others say, \"Nay, sorrow is the greater.\"\n\nBut I say unto you, they are inseparable.\n\nTogether they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.\n\n2. Help students to read and memorise the following extract from Tagore.\n\nSay not in grief that she is no more\n\nbut say in thankfulness that she was.\n\nA death is not the extinguishing of a light,\n\nbut the putting out of the\n\nlamp because the dawn has come.\n\n# For Anne Gregory\n\nThis poem is a conversation between a young man and a young woman. What are they arguing about?\n\n> \"Never shall a young man, Thrown into despair By those great honey-coloured Ramparts at your ear, Love you for yourself alone And not your yellow hair.\"\n\n\"But I can get a hair-dye And set such colour there, Brown, or black, or carrot, That young men in despair May love me for myself alone And not my yellow hair.\"\n\n\"I heard an old religious man But yesternight declare That he had found a text to prove That only God, my dear, Could love you for yourself alone And not your yellow hair.\"\n\nWILLIAM BUTLER YEATS\n\nWilliam Butler Yeats (1865–1939) was an Irish nationalist. He was educated in London and Dublin, and was interested in folklore and mythology. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1923.\n\nramparts: the high, wide walls around a castle or fort, for example, the ramparts of the Red Fort\n\n![](_page_8_Picture_2.jpeg)\n\n- 1. What does the young man mean by \"great honey-coloured /Ramparts at your ear?\" Why does he say that young men are \"thrown into despair\" by them?\n- 2. What colour is the young woman's hair? What does she say she can change it to? Why would she want to do so?\n- 3. Objects have qualities which make them desirable to others. Can you think of some objects (a car, a phone, a dress…) and say what qualities make one object more desirable than another? Imagine you were trying to sell an object: what qualities would you emphasise?\n- 4. What about people? Do we love others because we like their qualities, whether physical or mental? Or is it possible to love someone \"for themselves alone\"? Are some people 'more lovable' than others? Discuss this question in pairs or in groups, considering points like the following.\n  - (i) a parent or caregiver's love for a newborn baby, for a mentally or physically challenged child, for a clever child or a prodigy\n  - (ii) the public's love for a film star, a sportsperson, a politician, or a social worker\n  - (iii) your love for a friend, or brother or sister\n  - (iv) your love for a pet, and the pet's love for you.\n- 5. You have perhaps concluded that people are not objects to be valued for their qualities or riches rather than for themselves. But elsewhere Yeats asks the question: How can we separate the dancer from the dance? Is it possible to separate 'the person himself or herself' from how the person looks, sounds, walks, and so on? Think of how you or a friend or member of your family has changed over the years. Has your relationship also changed? In what way?\n\nFor Anne Gregory\n\n119",

        "answer": "A sermon is a religious or moral talk, typically delivered by a religious leader to teach spiritual lessons or moral principles. It differs from a lecture or talk in that it specifically focuses on religious or ethical teachings and is meant to guide people's spiritual lives. Yes, the word can be used negatively or jokingly to describe any long, moralizing speech that someone finds preachy or tedious, like when a parent gives lengthy advice about responsibilities."

        "answer": "Afflicted with: suffering from or affected by disease, pain, or distress. Be composed: to be calm, peaceful, and in control of one's emotions. Desolation: a state of complete emptiness, devastation, or deep sadness. Lamentation: the expression of grief, sorrow, or regret, often through crying or wailing. Procure: to obtain or acquire something. Be subject to: to be under the control or influence of something; to be liable or prone to something."

        "answer": "The Sermon on the Mount was delivered by Jesus Christ according to Christian tradition, found in the Gospel of Matthew. It contains important Christian teachings including the Beatitudes. The sermon at Benares was delivered by Gautama Buddha (also known as Sakyamuni). This was Buddha's first sermon after achieving enlightenment, delivered at the holy city of Benares on the River Ganges."

        "answer": "Kisa Gotami asks for medicine to cure her dead son. She does not get effective medicine because the child is already dead. The neighbors recognize that she has lost her senses due to grief and understand that no medicine can bring back the dead. Her request shows her inability to accept the reality of death due to overwhelming grief."

        "question": "Kisa Gotami again goes from house to house after she speaks with the Buddha. What does she ask for, the second time around? Does she get it? Why not?",
        "answer": "The second time, Kisa Gotami asks for mustard seeds from houses where no one has ever died - no child, husband, parent, or friend. She does not get the mustard seeds meeting this condition because she discovers that every house has experienced death. People are willing to give her mustard seeds, but none can provide seeds from a house untouched by death, as death is universal to all families."

        "answer": "The second time, Kisa Gotami understands that death is universal and common to all living beings. She realizes that she was being selfish in her grief, thinking only of her own loss while death affects everyone. She learns that suffering and death are part of the human condition. Yes, this was exactly what the Buddha wanted her to understand - that death is inevitable and universal, and that accepting this truth is the path to peace and freedom from excessive grief."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do you think Kisa Gotami understood this only the second time? In what way did the Buddha change her understanding?",
        "answer": "Kisa Gotami understood only the second time because the Buddha made her discover the truth through her own experience rather than just telling her directly. The first time, she was focused only on her own loss. The Buddha's method made her actively seek out families untouched by death, forcing her to confront the reality that death is universal. Through this experiential learning, she moved from self-centered grief to understanding the shared human condition. The Buddha changed her understanding by guiding her to discover wisdom through personal experience rather than mere instruction."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you usually understand the idea of 'selfishness'? Do you agree with Kisa Gotami that she was being 'selfish in her grief'?",
        "answer": "Selfishness typically means caring only about oneself without considering others. In the context of grief, Kisa Gotami's 'selfishness' refers to being so consumed by her own loss that she couldn't see that suffering is universal. Her realization that she was selfish doesn't mean grief itself is wrong, but rather that excessive, self-centered grief that blinds us to others' suffering and the nature of life is limiting. Many would agree that while grief is natural and necessary, becoming so absorbed in personal loss that we lose perspective on the shared human experience of mortality can be considered a form of selfishness."

        "question": "Break up this sentence into three simple sentences using semicolons: 'For there is not any means by which those who have been born can avoid dying; after reaching old age there is death; of such a nature are living beings.' Which has better rhythm?",
        "answer": "Three simple sentences: 'There is no way for those who have been born to avoid dying. After reaching old age, there is death. This is the nature of living beings.' The original sentence with semicolons has better rhythm because it creates a flowing, connected thought that builds upon itself. The semicolons create pauses that emphasize the progression of ideas while maintaining the philosophical, sermon-like quality. The simple sentences, while clearer, lose the meditative and interconnected flow that suits the Buddha's teaching style."

        "answer": "The 'great honey-coloured ramparts at your ear' refers to the young woman's beautiful golden/blonde hair that falls around her ears like protective walls around a castle. The young man says other young men are 'thrown into despair' because they become so captivated by her physical beauty (specifically her hair) that they fall desperately in love with her appearance rather than loving her for who she truly is as a person. The despair comes from being overwhelmed by physical attraction."

        "question": "What colour is the young woman's hair? What does she say she can change it to? Why would she want to do so?",
        "answer": "The young woman has yellow (golden/blonde) hair. She says she can change it to brown, black, or carrot (red) using hair dye. She wants to change it because she desires to be loved for herself alone, not for her physical appearance. By changing her distinctive beautiful hair color, she hopes to test whether someone can love her true self rather than being attracted merely to her physical beauty."

        "question": "Objects have qualities which make them desirable to others. Can you think of some objects and say what qualities make one object more desirable than another?",
        "answer": "Examples of desirable object qualities: A car might be desirable for its speed, fuel efficiency, safety features, brand prestige, or appearance. A phone might be valued for its camera quality, processing speed, battery life, or brand status. A dress might be desired for its fabric quality, design, color, fit, or fashion trend. When selling an object, you would emphasize qualities like durability, functionality, aesthetic appeal, value for money, uniqueness, or status symbol potential - essentially the features that meet buyers' practical needs or emotional desires."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do we love others because we like their qualities, or is it possible to love someone 'for themselves alone'? Are some people 'more lovable' than others?",
        "answer": "This is a complex philosophical question. Different types of love exist: (i) A parent's love for a child often seems unconditional, loving the child regardless of abilities or challenges. (ii) Public love for celebrities is usually based on admired qualities like talent or achievement. (iii) Love for friends and family members typically combines appreciation for their qualities with deeper acceptance of their whole being. (iv) Pet love often seems unconditional and mutual. While we're initially drawn to people by their qualities, deeper love often transcends specific attributes. True love might involve loving someone despite their flaws, suggesting that while qualities attract us, genuine love goes beyond them to embrace the whole person."

        "question": "Is it possible to separate 'the person himself or herself' from how the person looks, sounds, walks, and so on? Think of how relationships change over time.",
        "answer": "This reflects Yeats' question about separating the dancer from the dance. It's philosophically difficult to separate a person's essence from their physical and behavioral manifestations, as these external aspects often reflect and shape their inner self. As people change over time - physically aging, developing new interests, gaining wisdom or experience - relationships naturally evolve too. We might love someone's laugh, their way of thinking, or their kindness, but these are expressed through their physical being. The challenge is whether we can identify a core 'self' that remains constant despite changes, or whether we are the sum total of our ever-changing qualities and expressions."

        "answer": "This is a creative writing exercise where students should choose one topic and write about three paragraphs. For 'Teaching someone to understand a new or difficult idea,' students might discuss the Buddha's method of experiential learning with Kisa Gotami, emphasizing patience, practical examples, and allowing people to discover truth themselves. For 'Helping each other get over difficult times,' they could explore how community support, shared experiences, and understanding help people cope with grief and loss. For 'Thinking about oneself as unique or as one among billions,' students might reflect on the balance between individual identity and universal human experiences like death, love, and suffering that connect us all."

      "summary": "This chapter presents Buddha's famous first sermon at Benares through the story of Kisa Gotami, a grief-stricken mother who learns that death is universal to all living beings. The Buddha teaches her this wisdom not through direct instruction but by having her discover it through her own experience of seeking mustard seeds from houses untouched by death. The lesson emphasizes that accepting the universality of suffering and death leads to peace and freedom from selfish grief. The chapter also includes the poem 'For Anne Gregory' by W.B. Yeats, which explores whether it's possible to love someone for themselves alone rather than for their physical or other attractive qualities. Both texts examine fundamental questions about human nature, love, loss, and the search for deeper understanding beyond surface appearances."
