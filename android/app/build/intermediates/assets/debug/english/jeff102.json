Can you say which of the three countries named below had such a political system until very recently? (i) United States of America (ii) South Africa (iii) Australia*\n- *• Have you heard of Nelson Mandela? Mandela, and his African*\n- *National Congress, spent a lifetime fighting against apartheid. Mandela had to spend thirty years in prison. Finally, democratic elections were held in South Africa in 1994, and Mandela became the first black President of a new nation.*\n\n*In this extract from his autobiography,* Long Walk to Freedom*, Mandela speaks about a historic occasion, 'the inauguration'. Can you guess what the occasion might be? Check your guess with this news item (from the BBC) of 10 May 1994.*\n\n### Mandela Becomes South Africa's First Black President\n\nNelson Mandela has become South Africa's first Black President after more than three centuries of White rule. Mr Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) party won 252 of the 400 seats in the first democratic elections of South Africa's history.\n\nThe inauguration ceremony took place in the Union Buildings amphitheatre in Pretoria today, attended by politicians and dignitaries from more than 140 countries around the world. \"Never, never again will this beautiful land experience the oppression of one by another, \" said Nelson Mandela in his address.\n\n… Jubilant scenes on the streets of Pretoria followed the ceremony with blacks, whites and coloureds celebrating together... More than 100,000 South African men, women and children of all races sang and danced with joy.\n\n![](_page_0_Picture_12.jpeg)\n\n# Activity\n\n*In Column A are some expressions you will find in the text.

For the past few days I had been pleasantly besieged by dignitaries and world leaders who were coming to pay their respects before the inauguration. The inauguration would be the largest gathering ever of international leaders on South African soil.\n\nThe ceremonies took place in the lovely sandstone amphitheatre formed by the Union Buildings in Pretoria. For decades this had been the seat of white supremacy, and now it was the site of a rainbow gathering of different colours and nations for the installation of South Africa's first democratic, non-racial government.\n\nOn that lovely autumn day I was accompanied by my daughter Zenani. On the podium, Mr de Klerk was first sworn in as second deputy president. Then\n\n(to be) besieged by to be surrounded closely by\n\n### amphitheatre\n\na building without a roof, with many rows of seats rising in steps (typical of ancient Greece and Rome)\n\n![](_page_2_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nThabo Mbeki was sworn in as first deputy president. When it was my turn, I pledged to obey and uphold the Constitution and to devote myself to the wellbeing of the Republic and its people. To the assembled guests and the watching world, I said:\n\nToday, all of us do, by our presence here... confer glory and hope to newborn liberty. Out of the experience of an extraordinary human disaster that lasted too long, must be born a society of which all humanity will be proud.\n\nWe, who were outlaws not so long ago, have today been given the rare privilege to be host to the nations of the world on our own soil. We thank all of our distinguished international guests for having come to take possession with the people of our country of what is, after all, a common victory for justice, for peace, for human dignity.\n\nWe have, at last, achieved our political emancipation. We pledge ourselves to liberate all our people from the continuing bondage of poverty, deprivation, suffering, gender and other discrimination.\n\nNever, never, and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another.\n\nThe sun shall never set on so glorious a human achievement.\n\nLet freedom reign. God bless Africa!\n\n### Oral Comprehension Check\n\n18First Flight\n\n- *1. Where did the ceremonies take place? Can you name any public buildings in India that are made of sandstone?*\n- *2. Can you say how 10 May is an 'autumn day' in South Africa?*\n\nconfer (a formal word) here, give\n\n### We, who were outlaws\n\nbecause of its policy of apartheid, many countries had earlier broken off diplomatic relations with South Africa\n\n### emancipation\n\nfreedom from restriction\n\n### deprivation\n\nstate of not having one's rightful benefits\n\ndiscrimination\n\nbeing treated differently or unfavourably\n\n- *3. At the beginning of his speech, Mandela mentions \"an extraordinary human disaster\". What does he mean by this? What is the \"glorious … human achievement\" he speaks of at the end?*\n- *4. What does Mandela thank the international leaders for?*\n- *5. What ideals does he set out for the future of South Africa?*\n\nA few moments later we all lifted our eyes in awe as a spectacular array of South African jets, helicopters and troop carriers roared in perfect formation over the Union Buildings. It was not only a display of pinpoint precision and military force, but a demonstration of the military's loyalty to democracy, to a new government that had been freely and fairly elected. Only moments before, the highest generals of the South African defence force and police, their chests bedecked with ribbons and medals from days gone by, saluted me and pledged their loyalty. I was not unmindful of the fact that not so many years before they would not have saluted but arrested me. Finally a chevron of Impala jets left a smoke trail of the black, red, green, blue and gold of the new South African flag.\n\nThe day was symbolised for me by the playing of our two national anthems, and the vision of whites singing *'Nkosi Sikelel –iAfrika'* and blacks singing 'Die Stem', the old anthem of the Republic. Although that day neither group knew the lyrics of the anthem they once despised, they would soon know the words by heart.\n\nOn the day of the inauguration, I was overwhelmed with a sense of history. In the first decade of the twentieth century, a few years after the bitter Anglo-Boer war and before my own birth, the white-skinned peoples of South Africa patched up their differences and erected a system of racial domination against the dark-skinned peoples of their own land. The structure they created formed the basis of one of the harshest, most inhumane, societies the world has ever known. Now, in the last decade of the twentieth century, and my own eighth decade as a man, that system had been\n\nspectacular array an impressive display (colourful and attractive)\n\nnot unmindful of conscious of; aware of\n\nchevron a pattern in the shape of a V\n\ndespised had a very low opinion of\n\noverturned forever and replaced by one that recognised the rights and freedoms of all peoples, regardless of the colour of their skin.\n\nThat day had come about through the unimaginable sacrifices of thousands of my people, people whose suffering and courage can never be counted or repaid. I felt that day, as I have on so many other days, that I was simply the sum of all those African patriots who had gone before me. That long and noble line ended and now began again with me. I was pained that I was not able to thank them and that they were not able to see what their sacrifices had wrought.\n\nThe policy of apartheid created a deep and lasting wound in my country and my people. All of us will spend many years, if not generations, recovering from that profound hurt. But the decades of oppression and brutality had another, unintended, effect, and that was that it produced the Oliver Tambos, the Walter Sisulus, the Chief Luthulis, the Yusuf Dadoos, the Bram Fischers, the Robert Sobukwes of our time\\* — men of such extraordinary wrought (old fashioned, formal word) done, achieved\n\nprofound deep and strong\n\n![](_page_4_Picture_5.jpeg)\n\n*\\* These are some prominent names in the struggle against apartheid. (For the use of the definite article with proper nouns, see exercise II on page 25)* courage, wisdom and generosity that their like may never be known again. Perhaps it requires such depths of oppression to create such heights of character. My country is rich in the minerals and gems that lie beneath its soil, but I have always known that its greatest wealth is its people, finer and truer than the purest diamonds.\n\nIt is from these comrades in the struggle that I learned the meaning of courage. Time and again, I have seen men and women risk and give their lives for an idea. I have seen men stand up to attacks and torture without breaking, showing a strength and resilience that defies the imagination. I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.\n\nNo one is born hating another person because of the colour of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite. Even in the grimmest times in prison, when my comrades and I were pushed to our limits, I would see a glimmer of humanity in one of the guards, perhaps just for a second, but it was enough to reassure me and keep me going. Man's goodness is a flame that can be hidden but never extinguished.\n\n# Oral Comprehension Check\n\n- *1. What do the military generals do? How has their attitude changed, and why?*\n- *2. Why were two national anthems sung?*\n- *3. How does Mandela describe the systems of government in his country (i) in the first decade, and (ii) in the final decade, of the twentieth century?*\n- *4. What does courage mean to Mandela?*\n- *5. Which does he think is natural, to love or to hate?*\n\nIn life, every man has twin obligations obligations to his family, to his parents, to his wife and children; and he has an obligation to his people, his community, his country. In a civil and humane\n\n### resilience\n\nthe ability to deal with any kind of hardship and recover from its effects\n\n### pushed to our limits\n\npushed to the last point in our ability to bear pain\n\nsociety, each man is able to fulfil those obligations according to his own inclinations and abilities. But in a country like South Africa, it was almost impossible for a man of my birth and colour to fulfil both of those obligations. In South Africa, a man of colour who attempted to live as a human being was punished and isolated. In South Africa, a man who tried to fulfil his duty to his people was inevitably ripped from his family and his home and was forced to live a life apart, a twilight existence of secrecy and rebellion. I did not in the beginning choose to place my people above my family, but in attempting to serve my people, I found that I was prevented from fulfilling my obligations as a son, a brother, a father and a husband.\n\nI was not born with a hunger to be free. I was born free — free in every way that I could know. Free to run in the fields near my mother's hut, free to swim in the clear stream that ran through my village, free to roast mealies under the stars and ride the broad backs of slow-moving bulls. As long as I obeyed my father and abided by the customs of my tribe, I was not troubled by the laws of man or God.\n\n22First Flight\n\nIt was only when I began to learn that my boyhood freedom was an illusion, when I discovered as a young man that my freedom had already been taken from me, that I began to hunger for it. At first, as a student, I wanted freedom only for myself, the transitory freedoms of being able to stay out at night, read what I pleased and go where I chose. Later, as a young man in Johannesburg, I yearned for the basic and honourable freedoms of achieving my potential, of earning my keep, of marrying and having a family — the freedom not to be obstructed in a lawful life.\n\nBut then I slowly saw that not only was I not free, but my brothers and sisters were not free. I saw that it was not just my freedom that was curtailed, but the freedom of everyone who looked like I did. That is when I joined the African National Congress, and that is when the hunger for my own freedom became the greater hunger for the freedom curtailed reduced\n\nillusion\n\ntransitory not permanent\n\nsomething that appears to be real but is not\n\n### inclinations\n\nnatural tendencies of behaviour\n\ninevitably unavoidably\n\n![](_page_7_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nof my people. It was this desire for the freedom of my people to live their lives with dignity and selfrespect that animated my life, that transformed a frightened young man into a bold one, that drove a law-abiding attorney to become a criminal, that turned a family-loving husband into a man without a home, that forced a life-loving man to live like a monk. I am no more virtuous or self-sacrificing than the next man, but I found that I could not even enjoy the poor and limited freedoms I was allowed when I knew my people were not free. Freedom is indivisible; the chains on anyone of my people were the chains on all of them, the chains on all of my people were the chains on me.\n\nI knew that the oppressor must be liberated just as surely as the oppressed. A man who takes away another man's freedom is a prisoner of hatred; he is locked behind the bars of prejudice and narrowmindedness. I am not truly free if I am taking away someone else's freedom, just as surely as I am not free when my freedom is taken from me. The oppressed and the oppressor alike are robbed of their humanity.\n\nprejudice a strong dislike\n\nwithout any good reason\n\n# Oral Comprehension Check\n\n- *1.

There are nouns in the text (*formation*, *government*) which are formed from the corresponding verbs (*form, govern*) by suffixing -(*at*)*ion* or *ment*. There may be a change in the spelling of some verb – noun pairs: such as *rebel*, *rebellion*; *constitute*, *constitution*.\n\n| 1.<br>Make a list of such pairs of nouns and verbs in the text. |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n| Noun         | Verb       |\n|--------------|------------|\n| rebellion    | rebel      |\n| constitution | constitute |\n|              |            |\n|              |            |\n|              |            |\n|              |            |\n\n24First Flight\n\n![](_page_8_Figure_15.jpeg)\n\n## 2. Read the paragraph below. Fill in the blanks with the noun forms of the verbs in brackets.\n\nMartin Luther King's (contribute) to our history as an outstanding leader began when he came to the (assist) of Rosa Parks, a seamstress who refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white passenger. In those days American Blacks were confined to positions of second class citizenship by restrictive laws and customs. To break these laws would mean (subjugate) and (humiliate) by the police and the legal system. Beatings, (imprison) and sometimes death awaited those who defied the System. Martin Luther King's tactics of protest involved non-violent (resist) to racial injustice.\n\n### II. Using the Definite Article with Names\n\nYou know that the definite article 'the' is not normally used before proper nouns. Nor do proper nouns usually occur in the plural. (We do not say: \\**The Nelson Mandela*, or \\**Nelson Mandelas*.) But now look at this sentence from the text:\n\n… the decades of oppression and brutality … produced the Oliver Tambos, the Walter Sisulus, … of our time.\n\nUsed in this way with *the* and/or in the plural, a proper noun carries a special meaning. For example, what do you think the names above mean? Choose the right answer.\n\n- (a) *for example* Oliver Tambo, Walter Sisulu, …\n- (b) *many other men like* Oliver Tambo, Walter Sisulu …/*many men of their type or kind,* whose names may not be as well known.\n\nDid you choose option (b)? Then you have the right answer!\n\nHere are some more examples of 'the' used with proper names. Try to say what these sentences mean. (You may consult a dictionary if you wish. Look at the entry for 'the'.)\n\n- 1. Mr Singh regularly invites the Amitabh Bachchans and the Shah Rukh Khans to his parties.\n- 2. Many people think that Madhuri Dixit is the Madhubala of our times.\n- 3. History is not only the story of the Alexanders, the Napoleons and the Hitlers, but of ordinary people as well.\n\n### III. Idiomatic Expressions\n\nMatch the italicised phrases in Column A with the phrase nearest in meaning in Column B. (*Hint*: First look for the sentence in the text in which the phrase in Column A occurs.)\n\n|    | A                                                            | B                                                                                                                                                             |\n|----|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1. | I was not unmindful of<br>the fact                           | (i)<br>had not forgotten; was aware of the fact<br>(ii)<br>was not careful about the fact<br>(iii)<br>forgot or was not aware of the fact                     |\n| 2. | when my comrades<br>and I were<br>pushed to<br>our limits    | (i)<br>pushed by the guards to the wall<br>(ii)<br>took more than our share of beatings<br>(iii)<br>felt that we could not endure the<br>suffering any longer |\n| 3. | to reassure me and<br>keep me going                          | (i)<br>make me go on walking<br>(ii)<br>help me continue to live in hope in this<br>very difficult situation<br>(iii)<br>make me remain without complaining   |\n| 4. | the basic and<br>honourable freedoms<br>of…earning my keep,… | (i)<br>earning enough money to live on<br>(ii)<br>keeping what I earned<br>(iii)<br>getting a good salary                                                     |\n\n# 26First Flight\n\nIn groups, discuss the issues suggested in the box below.

You have the option of making your paragraph a humorous one. (Read the short verse given below.)\n\nWhen you were born you were pink When you grew up you became white When you are in the sun you are red When you are sick you are yellow When you are angry you are purple When you are shocked you are grey And you have the cheek to call me 'coloured'.\n\n### WHAT WE HAVE DONE\n\nShared Nelson Mandela's moving description of his inauguration as South Africa's first black President, and his thoughts on freedom.\n\n### WHAT YOU CAN D<sup>O</sup>\n\nDivide your class into three groups and give each group one of the following topics to research: (i) black Americans, and their fight against discrimination, (ii) women, and their fight for equality, (iii) the Vietnamese, and their fight for independence.\n\nChoose a student from each group to present a short summary of each topic to the class.\n\n# Homophones\n\nCan you find the words below that are spelt similarly, and sometimes even pronounced similarly, but have very different meanings? Check their pronunciation and meaning in a dictionary.\n\n- The bandage was wound around the wound.\n- The soldier decided to desert his dessert in the desert.\n\n![](_page_12_Figure_12.jpeg)\n\n# A Tiger in the Zoo\n\n*This poem contrasts a tiger in the zoo with the tiger in its natural habitat. The poem moves from the zoo to the jungle, and back again to the zoo. Read the poem silently once, and say which stanzas speak about the tiger in the zoo, and which ones speak about the tiger in the jungle.*\n\n> He stalks in his vivid stripes The few steps of his cage, On pads of velvet quiet, In his quiet rage.\n\nHe should be lurking in shadow, Sliding through long grass Near the water hole Where plump deer pass.\n\nHe should be snarling around houses At the jungle's edge, Baring his white fangs, his claws, Terrorising the village!\n\nBut he's locked in a concrete cell, His strength behind bars, Stalking the length of his cage, Ignoring visitors.\n\nHe hears the last voice at night, The patrolling cars, And stares with his brilliant eyes At the brilliant stars.\n\nLESLIE NORRIS\n\n![](_page_14_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nsnarls: makes an angry, warning sound\n\n- 1. Read the poem again, and work in pairs or groups to do the following tasks.\n  - (i) Find the words that describe the movements and actions of the tiger in the cage and in the wild. Arrange them in two columns.\n  - (ii) Find the words that describe the two places, and arrange them in two columns.\n\nNow try to share ideas about how the poet uses words and images to contrast the two situations.\n\n- 2. Notice the use of a word repeated in lines such as these:\n  - (i) On pads of velvet quiet, In his quiet rage.\n  - (ii) And stares with his brilliant eyes At the brilliant stars.\n\nWhat do you think is the effect of this repetition?\n\n3. Read the following two poems — one about a tiger and the other about a panther. Then discuss:\n\nAre zoos necessary for the protection or conservation of some species of animals? Are they useful for educating the public? Are there alternatives to zoos?\n\n# The Tiger\n\nThe tiger behind the bars of his cage growls, The tiger behind the bars of his cage snarls, The tiger behind the bars of his cage roars. Then he thinks. It would be nice not to be behind bars all The time Because they spoil my view I wish I were wild, not on show. But if I were wild, hunters might shoot me, But if I were wild, food might poison me, But if I were wild, water might drown me. Then he stops thinking And... The tiger behind the bars of his cage growls, The tiger behind the bars of his cage snarls, The tiger behind the bars of his cage roars.\n\nPETER NIBLETT\n\n# The Panther\n\nHis vision, from the constantly passing bars, has grown so weary that it cannot hold anything else. It seems to him there are a thousand bars; and behind the bars, no world. As he paces in cramped circles, over and over, the movement of his powerful soft strides is like a ritual dance around a centre in which a mighty will stands paralysed. Only at times, the curtain of the pupils lifts, quietly. An image enters in, rushes down through the tensed, arrested muscles, plunges into the heart and is gone.\n\nRAINER MARIA RILKE\n\n31\n\nA Tiger in the Zoo\n\n4. Take a point of view for or against zoos, or even consider both points of view and write a couple of paragraphs or speak about this topic for a couple of minutes in class.\n\n![](_page_15_Picture_4.jpeg)\n\nThe Greater Cats\n\nThe greater cats with golden eyes Stare out between the bars.

        "answer": "The correct matches are: (i) A rainbow gathering - A beautiful coming together of various peoples, like the colours in a rainbow; (ii) The seat of white supremacy - The centre of racial superiority; (iii) Be overwhelmed with a sense of history - Feel deeply emotional, remembering and understanding all the past events that have led up to the moment; (iv) Resilience that defies the imagination - A great ability (almost unimaginable) to remain unchanged by suffering; (v) A glimmer of humanity - A sign of human feeling (goodness, kindness, pity, justice, etc.); (vi) A twilight existence - A half-secret life, like a life lived in the fading light between sunset and darkness"

        "answer": "The inauguration ceremonies took place in the sandstone amphitheatre formed by the Union Buildings in Pretoria, South Africa.

        "question": "Can you say how 10 May is an 'autumn day' in South Africa?",
        "answer": "May 10th is an 'autumn day' in South Africa because South Africa is in the Southern Hemisphere, where seasons are opposite to those in the Northern Hemisphere. When it's spring/summer in countries like India or the USA (April-May), it's autumn/fall in South Africa. This is due to the Earth's tilt and orbital position around the sun."

        "question": "At the beginning of his speech, Mandela mentions 'an extraordinary human disaster'. What does he mean by this? What is the 'glorious human achievement' he speaks of at the end?",
        "answer": "The 'extraordinary human disaster' refers to the apartheid system - a system of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination that lasted for decades in South Africa, causing immense suffering to the black population. The 'glorious human achievement' refers to the peaceful transition from apartheid to democracy, the establishment of a non-racial government, and the triumph of justice, equality, and human dignity over oppression and racial discrimination."

      {
        "question": "What does Mandela thank the international leaders for?",
        "answer": "Mandela thanks the international leaders for coming to take possession with the people of South Africa of what he calls 'a common victory for justice, for peace, for human dignity.' He appreciates their presence as it represents global recognition and support for South Africa's transition to democracy, and acknowledges that this victory belongs not just to South Africa but to all humanity in the fight against injustice."
      },
      {
        "question": "What ideals does he set out for the future of South Africa?",
        "answer": "Mandela sets out several ideals: (1) Never again will there be oppression of one group by another; (2) Liberation of all people from poverty, deprivation, suffering, and discrimination based on gender and other factors; (3) A society that all humanity will be proud of; (4) Justice, peace, and human dignity for all; (5) True freedom and equality regardless of skin color; (6) A united nation where people of all races can live together harmoniously."

        "question": "What do the military generals do? How has their attitude changed, and why?",
        "answer": "The military generals salute Mandela and pledge their loyalty to the new democratic government. Their attitude has completely changed - previously, these same generals would have arrested Mandela rather than saluted him. This change occurred because South Africa transitioned from an apartheid system (where Mandela was considered a criminal and terrorist) to a democracy (where he became the legitimately elected president). The military display also demonstrated their loyalty to democracy and the new government."

      {
        "question": "Why were two national anthems sung?",
        "answer": "Two national anthems were sung to symbolize the unity and reconciliation of the new South Africa. 'Nkosi Sikelel-iAfrika' was the anthem of the liberation movement and black South Africans, while 'Die Stem' was the old anthem of the white-ruled Republic. Having both anthems sung, with whites singing the African anthem and blacks singing the old anthem, represented the coming together of all South Africans and the healing of racial divisions."

      {
        "question": "How does Mandela describe the systems of government in his country (i) in the first decade, and (ii) in the final decade, of the twentieth century?",
        "answer": "(i) In the first decade of the 20th century: After the Anglo-Boer war, white-skinned peoples patched up their differences and created a system of racial domination against dark-skinned peoples, forming the basis of one of the harshest, most inhumane societies the world has ever known. (ii) In the final decade of the 20th century: This oppressive system was overturned forever and replaced by one that recognized the rights and freedoms of all peoples, regardless of skin color - a democratic, non-racial government."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does courage mean to Mandela?",
        "answer": "To Mandela, courage is not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. He learned that a brave person is not someone who doesn't feel afraid, but someone who conquers that fear. He observed this through his comrades who risked and gave their lives for their ideals, showing strength and resilience in the face of attacks and torture, demonstrating that true courage involves overcoming fear rather than not experiencing it."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which does he think is natural, to love or to hate?",
        "answer": "Mandela believes that love is more natural than hate. He states that 'no one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion.' People must learn to hate, but if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, 'for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.' He supports this with his prison experience, where even in the grimmest times, he would see glimpses of humanity in the guards."
      },
      {
        "question": "What 'twin obligations' does Mandela mention?",
        "answer": "Mandela mentions two twin obligations every man has: (1) Obligations to his family - to his parents, wife, and children; (2) Obligations to his people - to his community and country. In a civil and humane society, a person can fulfill both obligations according to his inclinations and abilities, but in apartheid South Africa, it was nearly impossible for a black man to fulfill both simultaneously."
      },
      {
        "question": "What did being free mean to Mandela as a boy, and as a student? How does he contrast these 'transitory freedoms' with 'the basic and honourable freedoms'?",
        "answer": "As a boy, freedom meant being able to run in fields, swim in streams, roast corn under stars, and ride bulls - simple physical freedoms within his tribal environment. As a student, he wanted transitory freedoms like staying out at night, reading what he pleased, and going where he chose. He contrasts these with 'basic and honourable freedoms' - achieving his potential, earning his living, marrying and having a family, and living a lawful life without obstruction. The transitory freedoms were temporary and self-centered, while basic freedoms were fundamental human rights essential for dignity and self-respect."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does Mandela think the oppressor is free? Why/Why not?",
        "answer": "No, Mandela does not think the oppressor is free. He believes 'the oppressor must be liberated just as surely as the oppressed.' A person who takes away another's freedom becomes 'a prisoner of hatred' who is 'locked behind the bars of prejudice and narrow-mindedness.' Mandela argues that one cannot be truly free while taking away someone else's freedom, and both the oppressed and oppressor are robbed of their humanity through the system of oppression."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why did such a large number of international leaders attend the inauguration? What did it signify the triumph of?",
        "answer": "International leaders attended because this was a historic moment - the end of apartheid and the birth of a democratic, non-racial South Africa. It was the largest gathering of international leaders ever on South African soil. Their presence signified the triumph of justice over injustice, peace over conflict, human dignity over oppression, and democracy over authoritarianism. It also represented the international community's support for human rights and their recognition of this victory as belonging to all humanity."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does Mandela mean when he says he is 'simply the sum of all those African patriots' who had gone before him?",
        "answer": "Mandela means that he represents the collective struggle, sacrifices, and dreams of countless African freedom fighters who came before him. He doesn't see himself as an individual hero, but as the embodiment of all those who fought against oppression, many of whom died without seeing freedom. Their courage, sacrifice, and dedication live on through him. He feels he is carrying forward their legacy and that 'that long and noble line ended and now began again' with him, showing humility and connection to the broader liberation movement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Would you agree that the 'depths of oppression' create 'heights of character'? How does Mandela illustrate this? Can you add your own examples to this argument?",
        "answer": "Mandela argues that extreme oppression can forge extraordinary character, citing leaders like Oliver Tambo, Walter Sisulu, Chief Luthuli, and others who showed 'extraordinary courage, wisdom and generosity' that emerged from their suffering under apartheid. He illustrates this through people who risked their lives for ideals and showed incredible resilience under torture. Other examples might include: Holocaust survivors who became advocates for human rights, civil rights leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. who emerged from segregation, or Gandhi who developed his philosophy through experiencing discrimination. However, this doesn't justify oppression - rather, it shows the remarkable human capacity to transform suffering into strength and wisdom."
      },
      {
        "question": "How did Mandela's understanding of freedom change with age and experience?",
        "answer": "Mandela's understanding of freedom evolved through several stages: (1) As a boy: Physical freedom within his tribal environment - running, swimming, playing; (2) As a student: Personal freedoms like staying out late, reading freely, going where he wanted; (3) As a young man: Basic freedoms like achieving potential, earning a living, having a family; (4) As an adult: Realizing that individual freedom was meaningless while his people remained oppressed - 'Freedom is indivisible.' His perspective expanded from self-centered desires to understanding freedom as a collective right that must be shared by all people regardless of race."
      },
      {
        "question": "How did Mandela's 'hunger for freedom' change his life?",
        "answer": "Mandela's hunger for freedom completely transformed his identity and life path. It 'animated his life' and: transformed him from a frightened young man into a bold one; drove him from being a law-abiding attorney to becoming a 'criminal' in the eyes of the apartheid state; turned him from a family-loving husband into a man without a home; forced him from being a life-loving man to live like a monk. This hunger for his people's freedom became greater than his desire for personal freedom, leading him to sacrifice his personal life, career, and eventually spend 30 years in prison for the cause of liberation."

        "question": "Make a list of noun and verb pairs in the text (like formation/form, government/govern).",

      },
      {
        "question": "Fill in the blanks with noun forms: Martin Luther King's __(contribute)__ to our history as an outstanding leader began when he came to the __(assist)__ of Rosa Parks... To break these laws would mean __(subjugate)__ and __(humiliate)__ by the police... Beatings, __(imprison)__ and sometimes death awaited those who defied the system. Martin Luther King's tactics of protest involved non-violent __(resist)__ to racial injustice.",
        "answer": "The correct noun forms are: contribution (from contribute), assistance (from assist), subjugation (from subjugate), humiliation (from humiliate), imprisonment (from imprison), resistance (from resist). These nouns are formed by adding suffixes like -tion, -ance, -ment to the verb roots, sometimes with spelling changes."
      },
      {
        "question": "What do the names 'the Oliver Tambos, the Walter Sisulus' mean when used with 'the' and in plural form?",
        "answer": "When proper nouns are used with 'the' and in plural form, they mean 'many other men like Oliver Tambo, Walter Sisulu/many men of their type or kind, whose names may not be as well known.' This usage suggests there were many other freedom fighters with similar qualities of courage, wisdom, and generosity, even if they weren't as famous. It's a way of honoring the entire group of freedom fighters, not just the well-known leaders."
      },
      {
        "question": "Match idiomatic expressions with their meanings: (1) I was not unmindful of the fact (2) pushed to our limits (3) to reassure me and keep me going (4) earning my keep",
        "answer": "(1) I was not unmindful of the fact - (i) had not forgotten; was aware of the fact; (2) pushed to our limits - (iii) felt that we could not endure the suffering any longer; (3) to reassure me and keep me going - (ii) help me continue to live in hope in this very difficult situation; (4) earning my keep - (i) earning enough money to live on. These phrases show how context and usage create meanings beyond literal definitions."

        "question": "Complete the balanced sentences: (1) It requires such depths of oppression __ (2) Courage was not the absence of fear __ (3) The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid __ (4) If people can learn to hate __ (5) I was not born with a hunger to be free __",
        "answer": "(1) It requires such depths of oppression to create such heights of character. (2) Courage was not the absence of fear but the triumph over it. (3) The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid but he who conquers that fear. (4) If people can learn to hate they can be taught to love. (5) I was not born with a hunger to be free. I was born free. These balanced sentences show Mandela's rhetorical skill in using contrasts for emphasis and philosophical depth."

        "question": "Find words describing tiger's movements in cage vs. wild, and words describing the two places.",
        "answer": "Tiger in cage: stalks, few steps, pads of velvet quiet, quiet rage, locked, stalking the length, ignoring. Tiger in wild: lurking, sliding, snarling, baring fangs and claws, terrorising. Places - Cage: cage, concrete cell, bars, visitors, patrolling cars. Wild: shadow, long grass, water hole, jungle's edge, village. The poet contrasts the restricted, artificial movements in captivity with the natural, powerful movements in the wild, and the confined concrete environment with the natural jungle habitat."

        "question": "What is the effect of repetition in lines like 'On pads of velvet quiet, In his quiet rage' and 'And stares with his brilliant eyes At the brilliant stars'?",
        "answer": "The repetition creates emphasis and connects related ideas. In 'quiet...quiet,' it emphasizes the suppressed nature of the tiger's anger - he moves quietly but his rage is also quiet (contained/suppressed). In 'brilliant...brilliant,' it creates a parallel between the tiger's bright, intelligent eyes and the bright stars, suggesting a connection between the caged tiger and the free, natural world above. The repetition also creates a musical quality and makes the phrases more memorable and impactful."

        "question": "Are zoos necessary for protection of species, education, or are there alternatives?",
        "answer": "This is a complex debate with valid arguments on multiple sides. Arguments for zoos: They protect endangered species through breeding programs, educate the public about wildlife, conduct important research, and provide safe havens for animals that cannot survive in the wild. Arguments against: They deprive animals of natural habitats and behaviors, can cause psychological distress, and prioritize entertainment over animal welfare. Alternatives include: wildlife reserves, national parks, wildlife rehabilitation centers, virtual reality educational experiences, and supporting conservation efforts in natural habitats. The best approach likely combines ethical zoos focused on conservation with strong support for protecting natural habitats."

The ceremony at the Union Buildings in Pretoria symbolized the end of apartheid and the birth of a democratic, non-racial South Africa. Mandela reflects on the extraordinary transformation from a system of racial domination to one recognizing the rights of all people regardless of skin color. The chapter explores Mandela's personal evolution from a boy who took freedom for granted to a man who understood that individual freedom is meaningless without collective liberation. He emphasizes that both oppressor and oppressed are dehumanized by systems of oppression, and that courage means conquering fear rather than its absence. Through his journey from law-abiding citizen to 'criminal' to president, Mandela illustrates how the struggle for his people's freedom transformed his entire life, ultimately leading to a peaceful transition that inspired the world."
