You have also learnt to represent the data pictorially in the form of various graphs such as bar graphs, histograms (including those of varying widths) and frequency polygons. In fact, you went a step further by studying certain numerical representatives of the ungrouped data, also called measures of central tendency, namely, *mean*, *median* and *mode*. In this chapter, we shall extend the study of these three measures, i.e., mean, median and mode from ungrouped data to that of *grouped data*. We shall also discuss the concept of cumulative frequency, the cumulative frequency distribution and how to draw cumulative frequency curves, called *ogives*.\n\n## **13.2 Mean of Grouped Data**\n\nThe mean (or average) of observations, as we know, is the sum of the values of all the observations divided by the total number of observations. From Class IX, recall that if *x*1 *, x*<sup>2</sup> *,. . ., x*<sup>n</sup> are observations with respective frequencies *f* 1 *, f*2 *, . . ., f*<sup>n</sup> , then this means observation *x*<sup>1</sup> occurs *f* 1 times, *x*<sup>2</sup> occurs *f* 2 times, and so on.\n\nNow, the sum of the values of all the observations = *f* 1 *x*1 + *f*<sup>2</sup> *x*2 + . . . + *f n xn* , and the number of observations = *f* 1 + *f*<sup>2</sup> + . . . + *f n* .\n\nSo, the mean *x* of the data is given by\n\n$$\n\\overline{x} = \\frac{f_1 x_1 + f_2 x_2 + \\dots + f_n x_n}{f_1 + f_2 + \\dots + f_n}\n$$\n\nRecall that we can write this in short form by using the Greek letter (capital sigma) which means summation. That is,\n\n$$\n\\overline{x} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i x_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i}\n$$\n\nwhich, more briefly, is written as *x* = *i i i f x <sup>f</sup>* , if it is understood that *i* varies from 1 to *n*.\n\nLet us apply this formula to find the mean in the following example.\n\n**Example 1 :** The marks obtained by 30 students of Class X of a certain school in a Mathematics paper consisting of 100 marks are presented in table below. Find the mean of the marks obtained by the students.\n\n| Marks obtained<br>(x<br>)<br>i         | 10 | 20 | 36 | 40 | 50 | 56 | 60 | 70 | 72 | 80 | 88 | 92 | 95 |\n|----------------------------------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n| Number of<br>students (<br>f<br>)<br>i | 1  | 1  | 3  | 4  | 3  | 2  | 4  | 4  | 1  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 1  |\n\n**Solution:** Recall that to find the mean marks, we require the product of each *xi* with the corresponding frequency *f i* . So, let us put them in a column as shown in Table 13.1.\n\n## **Table 13.1**\n\n| Marks obtained<br>(x<br>)<br>i | Number of students<br>(<br>f<br>)<br>i | f<br>x<br>i<br>i            |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 10                             | 1                                      | 10                          |\n| 20                             | 1                                      | 20                          |\n| 36                             | 3                                      | 108                         |\n| 40                             | 4                                      | 160                         |\n| 50                             | 3                                      | 150                         |\n| 56                             | 2                                      | 112                         |\n| 60                             | 4                                      | 240                         |\n| 70                             | 4                                      | 280                         |\n| 72                             | 1                                      | 72                          |\n| 80                             | 1                                      | 80                          |\n| 88                             | 2                                      | 176                         |\n| 92                             | 3                                      | 276                         |\n| 95                             | 1                                      | 95                          |\n| Total                          | f<br>= 30<br>i                        | f<br>x<br>= 1779<br>i<br>i |\n\nNow,\n\n$$\n\\overline{x} = \\frac{\\sum f_i x_i}{\\sum f_i} = \\frac{1779}{30} = 59.3\n$$\n\nTherefore, the mean marks obtained is 59.3.\n\nIn most of our real life situations, data is usually so large that to make a meaningful study it needs to be condensed as grouped data. So, we need to convert given ungrouped data into grouped data and devise some method to find its mean.\n\nLet us convert the ungrouped data of Example 1 into grouped data by forming class-intervals of width, say 15. Remember that, while allocating frequencies to each class-interval, students falling in any upper class-limit would be considered in the next class, e.g., 4 students who have obtained 40 marks would be considered in the classinterval 40-55 and not in 25-40. With this convention in our mind, let us form a grouped frequency distribution table (see Table 13.2).\n\n### **Table 13.2**\n\n| Class interval     | 10 - 25 | 25 - 40 | 40 - 55 | 55 - 70 | 70 - 85 | 85 - 100 |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| Number of students | 2       | 3       | 7       | 6       | 6       | 6        |\n\nNow, for each class-interval, we require a point which would serve as the representative of the whole class. *It is assumed that the frequency of each classinterval is centred around its mid-point*. So the *mid-point* (or *class mark*) of each class can be chosen to represent the observations falling in the class. Recall that we find the mid-point of a class (or its class mark) by finding the average of its upper and lower limits. That is,\n\nClass mark = \n$$\n\\frac{\\text{Upper class limit} + \\text{Lower class limit}}{2}\n$$\n\nWith reference to Table 13.2, for the class 10-25, the class mark is 10 25 2 + , i.e.,\n\n17.5. Similarly, we can find the class marks of the remaining class intervals. We put them in Table 13.3. These class marks serve as our *x<sup>i</sup>* 's. Now, in general, for the *i*th class interval, we have the frequency *f i* corresponding to the class mark *x<sup>i</sup>* . We can now proceed to compute the mean in the same manner as in Example 1.\n\n| Class interval | Number of students<br>(<br>f<br>)<br>i | Class mark<br>(x<br>)<br>i | f<br>x<br>i<br>i                  |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| 10 - 25        | 2                                      | 17.5                       | 35.0                              |\n| 25 - 40        | 3                                      | 32.5                       | 97.5                              |\n| 40 - 55        | 7                                      | 47.5                       | 332.5                             |\n| 55 - 70        | 6                                      | 62.5                       | 375.0                             |\n| 70 - 85        | 6                                      | 77.5                       | 465.0                             |\n| 85 - 100       | 6                                      | 92.5                       | 555.0                             |\n| Total          | Σ<br>f<br>= 30<br>i                    |                            | Σ<br>f<br>x<br>= 1860.0<br>i<br>i |\n\n**Table 13.3**\n\nThe sum of the values in the last column gives us Σ *f i xi* . So, the mean *x* of the given data is given by\n\n$$\n\\overline{x} = \\frac{\\Sigma f_i x_i}{\\Sigma f_i} = \\frac{1860.0}{30} = 62\n$$\n\nThis new method of finding the mean is known as the **Direct Method**.\n\nWe observe that Tables 13.1 and 13.3 are using the same data and employing the same formula for the calculation of the mean but the results obtained are different. Can you think why this is so, and which one is more accurate? The difference in the two values is because of the mid-point assumption in Table 13.3, 59.3 being the exact mean, while 62 an approximate mean.\n\nSometimes when the numerical values of *x i* and *f i* are large, finding the product of *x<sup>i</sup>* and *f<sup>i</sup>* becomes tedious and time consuming. So, for such situations, let us think of a method of reducing these calculations.\n\nWe can do nothing with the *f i* 's, but we can change each *x i* to a smaller number so that our calculations become easy. How do we do this? What about subtracting a fixed number from each of these *x<sup>i</sup>* 's? Let us try this method.\n\nThe first step is to choose one among the *x<sup>i</sup>* 's as the *assumed mean*, and denote it by '*a*'. Also, to further reduce our calculation work, we may take '*a*' to be that *x<sup>i</sup>* which lies in the centre of *x*<sup>1</sup> , *x*<sup>2</sup> , . . ., *x<sup>n</sup>* . So, we can choose *a* = 47.5 or *a* = 62.5. Let us choose *a =* 47.5.\n\nThe next step is to find the difference *d<sup>i</sup>* between *a* and each of the *x i* 's, that is, the **deviation** of '*a*' from each of the *x<sup>i</sup>* 's.\n\ni.e., \n$$\nd_i = x_i - a = x_i - 47.5\n$$\n\nThe third step is to find the product of *d<sup>i</sup>* with the corresponding *f i* , and take the sum of all the *f i di* 's. The calculations are shown in Table 13.4.\n\n| Class interval | Number of<br>students<br>(<br>f<br>)<br>i | Class mark<br>(x<br>)<br>i | d<br>= x<br>– 47.5<br>i<br>i | f<br>d<br>i<br>i           |\n|----------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| 10 - 25        | 2                                         | 17.5                       | –30                          | –60                        |\n| 25 - 40        | 3                                         | 32.5                       | –15                          | –45                        |\n| 40 - 55        | 7                                         | 47.5                       | 0                            | 0                          |\n| 55 - 70        | 6                                         | 62.5                       | 15                           | 90                         |\n| 70 - 85        | 6                                         | 77.5                       | 30                           | 180                        |\n| 85 - 100       | 6                                         | 92.5                       | 45                           | 270                        |\n| Total          | Σf<br>= 30<br>i                           |                            |                              | Σf<br>d<br>= 435<br>i<br>i |\n\n### **Table 13.4**\n\nSo, from Table 13.4, the mean of the deviations, *d* = *f d* Σ Σ\n\nNow, let us find the relation between *d* and *x* .\n\nSince in obtaining *d<sup>i</sup>* , we subtracted *'a'* from each *x<sup>i</sup>* , so, in order to get the mean *x* , we need to add '*a*' to *d* . This can be explained mathematically as:\n\n*i i i*\n\n.\n\n*f*\n\nMean of deviations,  \n\\n\n$$\n\\overline{d} = \\frac{\\Sigma f_i d_i}{\\Sigma f_i}\n$$\n\\nSo,  \n\\n\n$$\n\\overline{d} = \\frac{\\Sigma f_i (x_i - a)}{\\Sigma f_i}\n$$\n\\n\n$$\n= \\frac{\\Sigma f_i x_i}{\\Sigma f_i} - \\frac{\\Sigma f_i a}{\\Sigma f_i}\n$$\n\\n\n$$\n= \\overline{x} - a \\frac{\\Sigma f_i}{\\Sigma f_i}\n$$\n\\n\n$$\n= \\overline{x} - a\n$$\n\\nSo,  \n\\n\n$$\n\\overline{x} = a + \\overline{d}\n$$\n\\ni.e.,  \n\\n\n$$\n\\overline{x} = a + \\frac{\\Sigma f_i d_i}{\\Sigma f_i}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the values of *a*, Σ*f i di* and Σ*f i* from Table 13.4, we get\n\n$$\n\\overline{x} = 47.5 + \\frac{435}{30} = 47.5 + 14.5 = 62.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the mean of the marks obtained by the students is 62.\n\nThe method discussed above is called the **Assumed Mean Method**.\n\n**Activity 1 :** From the Table 13.3 find the mean by taking each of *x i* (i.e., 17.5, 32.5, and so on) as '*a*'. What do you observe? You will find that the mean determined in each case is the same, i.e., 62. (Why ?)\n\nSo, we can say that the value of the mean obtained does not depend on the choice of '*a*'.\n\nObserve that in Table 13.4, the values in Column 4 are all multiples of 15. So, if we divide the values in the entire Column 4 by 15, we would get smaller numbers to multiply with *f i* .

Further, we discussed finding the mode of ungrouped data. Here, we shall discuss ways of obtaining a mode of grouped data. It is possible that more than one value may have the same maximum frequency. In such situations, the data is said to be multimodal. Though grouped data can also be multimodal, we shall restrict ourselves to problems having a single mode only.\n\nLet us first recall how we found the mode for ungrouped data through the following example.\n\n**Example 4 :** The wickets taken by a bowler in 10 cricket matches are as follows:\n\n2645 0 2 1323\n\nFind the mode of the data.\n\n**Solution :** Let us form the frequency distribution table of the given data as follows:\n\n| Number of<br>wickets | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n|----------------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Number of<br>matches | 1 | 1 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n\nClearly, 2 is the number of wickets taken by the bowler in the maximum number (i.e., 3) of matches. So, the mode of this data is 2.\n\nIn a grouped frequency distribution, it is not possible to determine the mode by looking at the frequencies. Here, we can only locate a class with the maximum frequency, called the **modal class**. The mode is a value inside the modal class, and is given by the formula:\n\n$$\n\\text{Mode} = l + \\left(\\frac{f_1 - f_0}{2f_1 - f_0 - f_2}\\right) \\times h\n$$\n\nwhere *l* = lower limit of the modal class,\n\n*h* = size of the class interval (assuming all class sizes to be equal),\n\n*f* 1 = frequency of the modal class,\n\n*f* 0 = frequency of the class preceding the modal class,\n\n*f* 2 = frequency of the class succeeding the modal class.\n\nLet us consider the following examples to illustrate the use of this formula.\n\n**Example 5 :** A survey conducted on 20 households in a locality by a group of students resulted in the following frequency table for the number of family members in a household:\n\n| Family size           | 1 - 3 | 3 - 5 | 5 - 7 | 7 - 9 | 9 - 11 |\n|-----------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|\n| Number of<br>families | 7     | 8     | 2     | 2     | 1      |\n\nFind the mode of this data.\n\n**Solution :** Here the maximum class frequency is 8, and the class corresponding to this frequency is 3 – 5. So, the modal class is 3 – 5.\n\nNow\n\n```\nmodal class = 3 – 5, lower limit (l) of modal class = 3, class size (h) = 2\n```\n\nfrequency ( *f* <sup>1</sup> ) of the modal class = 8,\n\nfrequency ( *f* <sup>0</sup> ) of class preceding the modal class = 7,\n\nfrequency ( *f* <sup>2</sup> ) of class succeeding the modal class = 2.\n\nNow, let us substitute these values in the formula :\n\nSTATISTICS 185\n\nMode = \n$$\nl + \\left(\\frac{f_1 - f_0}{2f_1 - f_0 - f_2}\\right) \\times h\n$$\n  \n=  $3 + \\left(\\frac{8 - 7}{2 \\times 8 - 7 - 2}\\right) \\times 2 = 3 + \\frac{2}{7} = 3.286$ \n\nTherefore, the mode of the data above is 3.286.\n\n**Example 6 :** The marks distribution of 30 students in a mathematics examination are given in Table 13.3 of Example 1. Find the mode of this data. Also compare and interpret the mode and the mean.\n\n**Solution :** Refer to Table 13.3 of Example 1. Since the maximum number of students (i.e., 7) have got marks in the interval 40 - 55, the modal class is 40 - 55. Therefore,\n\nthe lower limit (*l*) of the modal class = 40,\n\nthe class size ( *h*) = 15,\n\nthe frequency ( *f* <sup>1</sup> ) of modal class = 7,\n\nthe frequency ( *f* <sup>0</sup> ) of the class preceding the modal class = 3,\n\nthe frequency ( *f* <sup>2</sup> ) of the class succeeding the modal class = 6. Now, using the formula:\n\n$$\n\\text{Mode} = l + \\left(\\frac{f_1 - f_0}{2f_1 - f_0 - f_2}\\right) \\times h,\n$$\n\\n\n$$\n\\text{wee get}\n$$\n\\n\n$$\n\\text{Mode} = 40 + \\left(\\frac{7 - 3}{14 - 6 - 3}\\right) \\times 15 = 52\n$$\n\nSo, the mode marks is 52.\n\nNow, from Example 1, you know that the mean marks is 62.\n\nSo, the maximum number of students obtained 52 marks, while on an average a student obtained 62 marks.\n\n#### **Remarks :**\n\n1. In Example 6, the mode is less than the mean. But for some other problems it may be equal or more than the mean also.\n\n2. It depends upon the demand of the situation whether we are interested in finding the average marks obtained by the students or the average of the marks obtained by most of the students. In the first situation, the mean is required and in the second situation, the mode is required.\n\n**Activity 3 :** Continuing with the same groups as formed in Activity 2 and the situations assigned to the groups. Ask each group to find the mode of the data. They should also compare this with the mean, and interpret the meaning of both.\n\n**Remark :** The mode can also be calculated for grouped data with unequal class sizes. However, we shall not be discussing it.\n\n## **EXERCISE 13.2**\n\n**1.** The following table shows the ages of the patients admitted in a hospital during a year:\n\n| Age (in years)     | 5 - 15 | 15 - 25 | 25 - 35 | 35 - 45 | 45 - 55 | 55 - 65 |\n|--------------------|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Number of patients | 6      | 11      | 21      | 23      | 14      | 5       |\n\nFind the mode and the mean of the data given above.

Recall that for finding the median of ungrouped data, we first arrange the data values of the observations in\n\nascending order. Then, if *n* is odd, the median is the 1 2 *<sup>n</sup>* th observation. And, if *<sup>n</sup>*\n\nis even, then the median will be the average of the th 2 *<sup>n</sup>* and the 1 th 2 *n* observations.\n\nSuppose, we have to find the median of the following data, which gives the marks, out of 50, obtained by 100 students in a test :\n\n| Marks obtained     | 20 | 29 | 28 | 33 | 42 | 38 | 43 | 25 |\n|--------------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n| Number of students | 6  | 28 | 24 | 15 | 2  | 4  | 1  | 20 |\n\nFirst, we arrange the marks in ascending order and prepare a frequency table as follows :\n\n|  | Table 13.9 |\n|--|------------|\n|  |            |\n\n| Marks obtained | Number of students<br>(Frequency) |\n|----------------|-----------------------------------|\n| 20             | 6                                 |\n| 25             | 20                                |\n| 28             | 24                                |\n| 29             | 28                                |\n| 33             | 15                                |\n| 38             | 4                                 |\n| 42             | 2                                 |\n| 43             | 1                                 |\n| Total          | 100                               |\n\nHere *n* = 100, which is even. The median will be the average of the 2 *<sup>n</sup>* th and the 1 2 *<sup>n</sup>* th observations, i.e., the 50th and 51st observations. To find these\n\nobservations, we proceed as follows:\n\n| Marks obtained | Number of students |  |\n|----------------|--------------------|--|\n| 20             | 6                  |  |\n| upto 25        | 6 + 20 = 26        |  |\n| upto 28        | 26 + 24 = 50       |  |\n| upto 29        | 50 + 28 = 78       |  |\n| upto 33        | 78 + 15 = 93       |  |\n| upto 38        | 93 + 4 = 97        |  |\n| upto 42        | 97 + 2 = 99        |  |\n| upto 43        | 99 + 1 = 100       |  |\n\n| Table 13.10 |  |  |\n|-------------|--|--|\n|-------------|--|--|\n\nNow we add another column depicting this information to the frequency table above and name it as *cumulative frequency column*.\n\n| Marks obtained | Number of students | Cumulative frequency |  |\n|----------------|--------------------|----------------------|--|\n| 20             | 6                  | 6                    |  |\n| 25             | 20                 | 26                   |  |\n| 28             | 24                 | 50                   |  |\n| 29             | 28                 | 78                   |  |\n| 33             | 15                 | 93                   |  |\n| 38             | 4                  | 97                   |  |\n| 42             | 2                  | 99                   |  |\n| 43             | 1                  | 100                  |  |\n\n**Table 13.11**\n\nFrom the table above, we see that:\n\n50th observaton is 28 (Why?)\n\n51st observation is 29\n\nSo, Median = \n$$\n\\frac{28 + 29}{2} = 28.5\n$$\n\n**Remark :** The part of Table 13.11 consisting Column 1 and Column 3 is known as *Cumulative Frequency Table*. The median marks 28.5 conveys the information that about 50% students obtained marks less than 28.5 and another 50% students obtained marks more than 28.5.\n\nNow, let us see how to obtain the median of grouped data, through the following situation.\n\nConsider a grouped frequency distribution of marks obtained, out of 100, by 53 students, in a certain examination, as follows:\n\n| Marks    | Number of students |  |\n|----------|--------------------|--|\n| 0 - 10   | 5                  |  |\n| 10 - 20  | 3                  |  |\n| 20 - 30  | 4                  |  |\n| 30 - 40  | 3                  |  |\n| 40 - 50  | 3                  |  |\n| 50 - 60  | 4                  |  |\n| 60 - 70  | 7                  |  |\n| 70 - 80  | 9                  |  |\n| 80 - 90  | 7                  |  |\n| 90 - 100 | 8                  |  |\n\n| Table 13.12 |  |\n|-------------|--|\n|             |  |\n\nFrom the table above, try to answer the following questions:\n\nHow many students have scored marks less than 10? The answer is clearly 5.\n\nHow many students have scored less than 20 marks? Observe that the number of students who have scored less than 20 include the number of students who have scored marks from 0 - 10 as well as the number of students who have scored marks from 10 - 20. So, the total number of students with marks less than 20 is 5 + 3, i.e., 8. We say that the cumulative frequency of the class 10 -20 is 8.\n\nSimilarly, we can compute the cumulative frequencies of the other classes, i.e., the number of students with marks less than 30, less than 40, . . ., less than 100. We give them in Table 13.13 given below:\n\n| Marks obtained | Number of students<br>(Cumulative frequency) |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Less than 10   | 5                                            |\n| Less than 20   | 5 + 3 = 8                                    |\n| Less than 30   | 8 + 4 = 12                                   |\n| Less than 40   | 12 + 3 = 15                                  |\n| Less than 50   | 15 + 3 = 18                                  |\n| Less than 60   | 18 + 4 = 22                                  |\n| Less than 70   | 22 + 7 = 29                                  |\n| Less than 80   | 29 + 9 = 38                                  |\n| Less than 90   | 38 + 7 = 45                                  |\n| Less than 100  | 45 + 8 = 53                                  |\n|                |                                              |\n\n| Table 13.13 |  |\n|-------------|--|\n|-------------|--|\n\nThe distribution given above is called the *cumulative frequency distribution of the less than type*. Here 10, 20, 30, . . . 100, are the upper limits of the respective class intervals.\n\nWe can similarly make the table for the number of students with scores, more than or equal to 0, more than or equal to 10, more than or equal to 20, and so on. From Table 13.12, we observe that all 53 students have scored marks more than or equal to 0. Since there are 5 students scoring marks in the interval 0 - 10, this means that there are 53 – 5 = 48 students getting more than or equal to 10 marks. Continuing in the same manner, we get the number of students scoring 20 or above as 48 – 3 = 45, 30 or above as 45 – 4 = 41, and so on, as shown in Table 13.14.\n\n| Marks obtained           | Number of students<br>(Cumulative frequency) |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| More than or equal to 0  | 53                                           |\n| More than or equal to 10 | 53 – 5 = 48                                  |\n| More than or equal to 20 | 48 – 3 = 45                                  |\n| More than or equal to 30 | 45 – 4 = 41                                  |\n| More than or equal to 40 | 41 – 3 = 38                                  |\n| More than or equal to 50 | 38 – 3 = 35                                  |\n| More than or equal to 60 | 35 – 4 = 31                                  |\n| More than or equal to 70 | 31 – 7 = 24                                  |\n| More than or equal to 80 | 24 – 9 = 15                                  |\n| More than or equal to 90 | 15 – 7 = 8                                   |\n\n**Table 13.14**\n\nThe table above is called a *cumulative frequency distribution of the more than type*. Here 0, 10, 20, . . ., 90 give the lower limits of the respective class intervals.\n\nNow, to find the median of grouped data, we can make use of any of these cumulative frequency distributions.\n\nLet us combine Tables 13.12 and 13.13 to get Table 13.15 given below:\n\n| Marks    | Number of students<br>(<br>f<br>) | Cumulative frequency<br>(cf<br>) |\n|----------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| 0 - 10   | 5                                 | 5                                |\n| 10 - 20  | 3                                 | 8                                |\n| 20 - 30  | 4                                 | 12                               |\n| 30 - 40  | 3                                 | 15                               |\n| 40 - 50  | 3                                 | 18                               |\n| 50 - 60  | 4                                 | 22                               |\n| 60 - 70  | 7                                 | 29                               |\n| 70 - 80  | 9                                 | 38                               |\n| 80 - 90  | 7                                 | 45                               |\n| 90 - 100 | 8                                 | 53                               |\n\n**Table 13.15**\n\nNow in a grouped data, we may not be able to find the middle observation by looking at the cumulative frequencies as the middle observation will be some value in a class interval. It is, therefore, necessary to find the value inside a class that divides the whole distribution into two halves. But which class should this be?\n\nTo find this class, we find the cumulative frequencies of all the classes and 2 *n* . We now locate the class whose cumulative frequency is greater than (and nearest to) 2 *<sup>n</sup>* This is called the *median class*. In the distribution above, *n* = 53. So, 2 *n* = 26.5. Now 60 – 70 is the class whose cumulative frequency 29 is greater than (and nearest to) 2 *n* , i.e., 26.5.\n\nTherefore, 60 – 70 is the **median class**.\n\nAfter finding the median class, we use the following formula for calculating the median.\n\nMedian = \n$$\nl + \\left(\\frac{\\frac{n}{2} - cf}{f}\\right) \\times h\n$$\n,\n\nwhere *l* = lower limit of median class,\n\n*n* = number of observations,\n\ncf = cumulative frequency of class preceding the median class,\n\n*f* = frequency of median class,\n\n*h* = class size (assuming class size to be equal).\n\nSubstituting the values 26.5, <sup>2</sup> *<sup>n</sup> <sup>l</sup>* = 60, cf = 22, *f* = 7, *h* = 10\n\nin the formula above, we get\n\nMedian = \n$$\n60 + \\left(\\frac{26.5 - 22}{7}\\right) \\times 10\n$$\n  \n=  $60 + \\frac{45}{7}$   \n= 66.4\n\nSo, about half the students have scored marks less than 66.4, and the other half have scored marks more than 66.4.\n\n| Height (in cm) | Number of girls |  |\n|----------------|-----------------|--|\n| Less than 140  | 4               |  |\n| Less than 145  | 11              |  |\n| Less than 150  | 29              |  |\n| Less than 155  | 40              |  |\n| Less than 160  | 46              |  |\n| Less than 165  | 51              |  |\n\n**Example 7 :** A survey regarding the heights (in cm) of 51 girls of Class X of a school was conducted and the following data was obtained:\n\nFind the median height.\n\n**Solution :** To calculate the median height, we need to find the class intervals and their corresponding frequencies.\n\nThe given distribution being of the *less than type*, 140, 145, 150, . . ., 165 give the upper limits of the corresponding class intervals. So, the classes should be below 140, 140 - 145, 145 - 150, . . ., 160 - 165. Observe that from the given distribution, we find that there are 4 girls with height less than 140, i.e., the frequency of class interval below 140 is 4. Now, there are 11 girls with heights less than 145 and 4 girls with height less than 140. Therefore, the number of girls with height in the interval 140 - 145 is 11 – 4 = 7. Similarly, the frequency of 145 - 150 is 29 – 11 = 18, for 150 - 155, it is 40 – 29 = 11, and so on. So, our frequency distribution table with the given cumulative frequencies becomes:\n\n| Table 13.16 |  |  |\n|-------------|--|--|\n|-------------|--|--|\n\n| Class intervals | Frequency | Cumulative frequency |  |  |  |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------------------|--|--|--|\n| Below 140       | 4         | 4                    |  |  |  |\n| 140 - 145       | 7         | 11                   |  |  |  |\n| 145 - 150       | 18        | 29                   |  |  |  |\n| 150 - 155       | 11        | 40                   |  |  |  |\n| 155 - 160       | 6         | 46                   |  |  |  |\n| 160 - 165       | 5         | 51                   |  |  |  |\n|                 |           |                      |  |  |  |\n\nNow *n* = 51. So, <sup>51</sup> 25.5 2 2 *n* = = . This observation lies in the class 145 - 150. Then, *l* (the lower limit) = 145, cf (the cumulative frequency of the class preceding 145 - 150) = 11, *f* (the frequency of the median class 145 - 150) = 18, *h* (the class size) = 5. Using the formula, Median = *l* + cf 2 *n h f* <sup>−</sup> × , we have Median = 25.5 11 <sup>145</sup> <sup>5</sup> 18 − + × = 145 + 72.5 <sup>18</sup> = 149.03.\n\nSo, the median height of the girls is 149.03 cm.\n\nThis means that the height of about 50% of the girls is less than this height, and 50% are taller than this height.\n\n**Example 8 :** The median of the following data is 525.

It also enables us to compare two or more distributions. For example, by comparing the average (mean) results of students of different schools of a particular examination, we can conclude which school has a better performance.\n\nHowever, extreme values in the data affect the mean. For example, the mean of classes having frequencies more or less the same is a good representative of the data. But, if one class has frequency, say 2, and the five others have frequency 20, 25, 20, 21, 18, then the mean will certainly not reflect the way the data behaves. So, in such cases, the mean is not a good representative of the data.\n\nIn problems where individual observations are not important, and we wish to find out a 'typical' observation, the median is more appropriate, e.g., finding the typical productivity rate of workers, average wage in a country, etc. These are situations where extreme values may be there. So, rather than the mean, we take the median as a better measure of central tendency.\n\nIn situations which require establishing the most frequent value or most popular item, the mode is the best choice, e.g., to find the most popular T.V. programme being watched, the consumer item in greatest demand, the colour of the vehicle used by most of the people, etc.\n\n### **Remarks :**\n\n1. There is a empirical relationship between the three measures of central tendency :\n\n### **3 Median = Mode + 2 Mean**\n\n2. The median of grouped data with unequal class sizes can also be calculated. However, we shall not discuss it here.\n\n## **EXERCISE 13.3**\n\n**1.** The following frequency distribution gives the monthly consumption of electricity of 68 consumers of a locality.

Find the median weight of the students.\n\n| Weight (in kg)     | 40 - 45 | 45 - 50 | 50 - 55 | 55 - 60 | 60 - 65 | 65 - 70 | 70 - 75 |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Number of students | 2       | 3       | 8       | 6       | 6       | 3       | 2       |\n\n## **13.5 Summary**\n\nIn this chapter, you have studied the following points:\n\n**1.** The mean for grouped data can be found by :\n\n(i) the direct method : \n$$\n\\overline{x} = \\frac{\\sum f_i x_i}{\\sum f_i}\n$$\n\n(ii) the assumed mean method : \n$$\n\\overline{x} = a + \\frac{\\sum f_i d_i}{\\sum f_i}\n$$\n\n(iii) the step deviation method : *i i i f u <sup>x</sup> a h f* ,\n\nwith the assumption that the frequency of a class is centred at its mid-point, called its class mark.\n\n**2.** The mode for grouped data can be found by using the formula:\n\nMode = \n$$\nl + \\left(\\frac{f_1 - f_0}{2f_1 - f_0 - f_2}\\right) \\times h\n$$\n\nwhere symbols have their usual meanings.\n\n- **3.** The cumulative frequency of a class is the frequency obtained by adding the frequencies of all the classes preceding the given class.\n- **4.** The median for grouped data is formed by using the formula:\n\nMedian = \n$$\nl + \\left(\\frac{\\frac{n}{2} - cf}{f}\\right) \\times h\n$$\n,\n\nwhere symbols have their usual meanings.\n\n# **A NOTE TO THE READER**\n\nFor calculating mode and median for grouped data, it should be ensured that the class intervals are continuous before applying the formulae. Same condition also apply for construction of an ogive. Further, in case of ogives, the scale may not be the same on both the axes.",
