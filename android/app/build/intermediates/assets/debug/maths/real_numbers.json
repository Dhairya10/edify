        "html_content": "<h1>Chapter 5: Real Numbers</h1><h2>5.1 Introduction</h2><p>In earlier classes, we have studied about natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, and rational numbers. We have seen that the collection of rational numbers does not fill up the number line completely. There are many holes or gaps left to be filled up. This leads us to the concept of irrational numbers.</p><p>In this chapter, we shall extend this and study about some very important properties of positive integers in the context of divisibility. We will also prove the irrationality of √2, √3, √5 and in general √p where p is a prime. We will explain what rational and irrational numbers are, and together they make up the real numbers.</p><h2>5.2 Euclid's Division Lemma</h2><p>Euclid's division lemma is a proven statement used for proving another statement. Let us state Euclid's division lemma.</p><p><strong>Euclid's Division Lemma:</strong> Given positive integers a and b, there exist unique integers q and r satisfying a = bq + r, where 0 ≤ r < b.</p><p>Here, a is called the dividend, b is called the divisor, q is called the quotient and r is called the remainder.</p><h3>Example 1:</h3><p>Use Euclid's division lemma to find the HCF of 455 and 42.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Step 1: Since 455 > 42, we apply the division lemma to 455 and 42 to get<br>455 = 42 × 10 + 35</p><p>Step 2: Since the remainder 35 ≠ 0, we apply the division lemma to 42 and 35 to get<br>42 = 35 × 1 + 7</p><p>Step 3: We consider the new divisor 35 and remainder 7, and apply the division lemma to get<br>35 = 7 × 5 + 0</p><p>Since the remainder is now zero, the process stops. Since the divisor at this stage is 7, therefore, HCF(455, 42) = 7.</p><h2>5.3 The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic</h2><p>The fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that every composite number can be expressed as a product of primes, and this factorization is unique, apart from the order in which the prime factors occur.</p><p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Every composite number can be expressed (factorised) as a product of primes, and this factorisation is unique, apart from the order in which the prime factors occur.</p><h3>Example 2:</h3><p>Find the prime factorisation of 32760 and use it to find the HCF and LCM of 32760 and 1584.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>32760 = 2³ × 3² × 5 × 7 × 13<br>1584 = 2⁴ × 3² × 11</p><p>For HCF, we take the lowest power of each common prime factor:<br>HCF = 2³ × 3² = 8 × 9 = 72</p><p>For LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor:<br>LCM = 2⁴ × 3² × 5 × 7 × 11 × 13 = 16 × 9 × 5 × 7 × 11 × 13 = 720720</p><h2>5.4 Revisiting Irrational Numbers</h2><p>In Class IX, we defined an irrational number to be a number which cannot be written in the form p/q, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. We also proved that √2, √3, √5 are irrational numbers.</p><p>Let us recall the method of proof. We use a technique called 'proof by contradiction'. In this technique, we assume the opposite of what we want to prove and show that it leads to a contradiction.</p><h3>Theorem: √2 is irrational</h3><p><strong>Proof:</strong> Let us assume, to the contrary, that √2 is rational.</p><p>So, we can find integers r and s (≠ 0) such that √2 = r/s.</p><p>Suppose r and s have a common factor other than 1. Then, we divide by the common factor to get √2 = a/b, where a and b are coprime.</p><p>So, b√2 = a, which gives us 2b² = a².</p><p>Therefore, 2 divides a². Now, by Theorem 5.3, it follows that 2 divides a.</p><p>So, we can write a = 2c for some integer c. Substituting for a, we get 2b² = 4c², that is, b² = 2c².</p><p>This means that 2 divides b². So, 2 divides b.</p><p>Therefore, a and b have at least 2 as a common factor. But this contradicts the fact that a and b are coprime.</p><p>This contradiction has arisen because of our incorrect assumption that √2 is rational. So, we conclude that √2 is irrational.</p><h2>5.5 Revisiting Rational Numbers and Their Decimal Expansions</h2><p>In Class IX, we studied about decimal expansions of rational numbers. Let us recall what we found:</p><p>1. The decimal expansion of a rational number is either terminating or non-terminating repeating.</p><p>2. Conversely, a number whose decimal expansion is terminating or non-terminating repeating is rational.</p><h3>Theorem:</h3><p>Let x = p/q be a rational number, such that the prime factorisation of q is of the form 2ᵐ × 5ⁿ, where m, n are non-negative integers. Then x has a decimal expansion which terminates.</p><h3>Example 3:</h3><p>Check whether the rational numbers will have terminating decimal expansion or non-terminating repeating decimal expansion:</p><p>(i) 13/3125   (ii) 17/8   (iii) 15/1600   (iv) 29/343</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>(i) 13/3125: 3125 = 5⁵, so the decimal expansion terminates.</p><p>(ii) 17/8: 8 = 2³, so the decimal expansion terminates.</p><p>(iii) 15/1600: 1600 = 2⁶ × 5², so the decimal expansion terminates.</p><p>(iv) 29/343: 343 = 7³. Since the denominator has 7 as a factor (other than 2 and 5), the decimal expansion is non-terminating repeating.</p><h2>5.6 Real Numbers</h2><p>The collection of all rational and irrational numbers together make up what we call the collection of real numbers, which is denoted by ℝ.</p><p>A real number is either rational or irrational. The decimal expansion of a real number is either terminating, or non-terminating repeating, or non-terminating non-repeating.</p><p>Moreover, we can visualise real numbers as points on the number line. Also, corresponding to each point on the number line, there is a unique real number.</p><p>This is why we call the number line the real number line, and often we simply refer to it as the number line.</p>",
