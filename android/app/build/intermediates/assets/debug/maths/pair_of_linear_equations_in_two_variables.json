For example, if we buy 2 pens and 3 pencils for ₹23, and 4 pens and 1 pencil for ₹28, we need to find the cost of one pen and one pencil. Such problems lead us to a system of linear equations in two variables.</p><p>A linear equation in two variables x and y is an equation of the form ax + by + c = 0, where a, b, c are real numbers and a and b are not both zero. When we have two such equations, we get a pair of linear equations in two variables.</p><h2>2.2 Pair of Linear Equations in Two Variables</h2><p>A pair of linear equations in two variables can be written in the general form:</p><p>a₁x + b₁y + c₁ = 0</p><p>a₂x + b₂y + c₂ = 0</p><p>where a₁, b₁, c₁, a₂, b₂, c₂ are real numbers such that a₁² + b₁² ≠ 0 and a₂² + b₂² ≠ 0.</p><h3>2.2.1 Solution of a Pair of Linear Equations</h3><p>A solution of a pair of linear equations in two variables is a pair of values (x, y) which satisfies both the equations simultaneously.</p><h2>2.3 Graphical Method of Solution</h2><p>Every linear equation in two variables represents a straight line when plotted on a coordinate plane. The solution of a pair of linear equations corresponds to the point of intersection of the two lines represented by the equations.</p><h3>2.2.1 Different Cases</h3><p><strong>Case 1: Intersecting Lines</strong><br>When the two lines intersect at exactly one point, the pair of equations has a unique solution. This happens when a₁/a₂ ≠ b₁/b₂.</p><p><strong>Case 2: Coincident Lines</strong><br>When the two lines coincide (are the same line), the pair of equations has infinitely many solutions. This happens when a₁/a₂ = b₁/b₂ = c₁/c₂.</p><p><strong>Case 3: Parallel Lines</strong><br>When the two lines are parallel and distinct, the pair of equations has no solution. This happens when a₁/a₂ = b₁/b₂ ≠ c₁/c₂.</p><h2>2.4 Algebraic Methods of Solution</h2><h3>2.4.1 Substitution Method</h3><p>In this method, we express one variable in terms of the other from one equation and substitute this expression in the other equation.</p><p><strong>Steps:</strong></p><p>1. From one of the equations, express one variable in terms of the other<br>2. Substitute this expression in the other equation<br>2. Solve the resulting equation in one variable<br>4. Substitute back to find the other variable</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Solve the system:<br>x + y = 5 ... (1)<br>2x - y = 4 ... (2)</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>From equation (1): y = 5 - x ... (3)<br>Substituting in equation (2): 2x - (5 - x) = 4<br>2x - 5 + x = 4<br>3x = 9<br>x = 3<br>Substituting x = 3 in equation (3): y = 5 - 3 = 2<br>Therefore, x = 3, y = 2</p><h3>2.4.2 Elimination Method</h3><p>In this method, we eliminate one variable by making the coefficients of one variable equal and then adding or subtracting the equations.</p><p><strong>Steps:</strong></p><p>1. Make the coefficients of one variable equal by multiplying the equations with suitable numbers<br>2. Add or subtract the equations to eliminate one variable<br>2. Solve the resulting equation in one variable<br>4. Substitute back to find the other variable</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Solve the system:<br>3x + 2y = 11 ... (1)<br>2x + 3y = 4 ... (2)</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>Multiply equation (1) by 3 and equation (2) by 2:<br>9x + 6y = 33 ... (3)<br>4x + 6y = 8 ... (4)<br>Subtracting equation (4) from equation (3):<br>5x = 25<br>x = 5<br>Substituting x = 5 in equation (1): 3(5) + 2y = 11<br>15 + 2y = 11<br>2y = -4<br>y = -2<br>Therefore, x = 5, y = -2</p><h3>2.4.3 Cross-Multiplication Method</h3><p>For the general pair of equations:<br>a₁x + b₁y + c₁ = 0<br>a₂x + b₂y + c₂ = 0</p><p>The solution is given by:<br>x/(b₁c₂ - b₂c₁) = y/(c₁a₂ - c₂a₁) = 1/(a₁b₂ - a₂b₁)</p><p>This gives us:<br>x = (b₁c₂ - b₂c₁)/(a₁b₂ - a₂b₁)<br>y = (c₁a₂ - c₂a₁)/(a₁b₂ - a₂b₁)</p><h2>2.5 Equations Reducible to a Pair of Linear Equations in Two Variables</h2><p>Some equations which are not linear can be reduced to linear equations by suitable substitutions.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Equations of the form:<br>a₁/(x) + b₁/(y) = c₁<br>a₂/(x) + b₂/(y) = c₂</p><p>Can be solved by substituting u = 1/x and v = 1/y, which gives:<br>a₁u + b₁v = c₁<br>a₂u + b₂v = c₂</p><h2>2.6 Applications</h2><p>Pair of linear equations in two variables have numerous real-life applications including:</p><p>• Problems related to ages<br>• Problems related to numbers<br>• Time, speed and distance problems<br>• Problems related to boats and streams<br>• Mixture problems<br>• Geometry problems</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> The sum of two numbers is 25 and their difference is 5. Find the numbers.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>Let the two numbers be x and y.<br>According to the problem:<br>x + y = 25 ... (1)<br>x - y = 5 ... (2)<br>Adding equations (1) and (2): 2x = 30, so x = 15<br>Substituting in equation (1): 15 + y = 25, so y = 10<br>Therefore, the two numbers are 15 and 10.</p>",
