She wanted to enjoy rides on the Giant Wheel and play Hoopla (a game in which you throw a ring on the items kept in a stall, and if the ring covers any object completely, you get it). The number of times she played Hoopla is half the number of rides she had on the Giant Wheel. If each ride costs ` 3, and a game of Hoopla costs ` 4, how would you find out the number of rides she had and how many times she played Hoopla, provided she spent ` 20.\n\nMay be you will try it by considering different cases. If she has one ride, is it possible? Is it possible to have two rides? And so on. Or you may use the knowledge of Class IX, to represent such situations as linear equations in two variables.\n\n![](_page_0_Picture_6.jpeg)\n\nLet us try this approach.\n\nDenote the number of rides that Akhila had by *x*, and the number of times she played Hoopla by *y*. Now the situation can be represented by the two equations:\n\n$$\ny = \\frac{1}{2}x\\tag{1}\n$$\n\n$$\n3x + 4y = 20\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nCan we find the solutions of this pair of equations? There are several ways of finding these, which we will study in this chapter.\n\n### **3.2 Graphical Method of Solution of a Pair of Linear Equations**\n\nA pair of linear equations which has no solution, is called an *inconsistent* pair of linear equations. A pair of linear equations in two variables, which has a solution, is called a *consistent* pair of linear equations. A pair of linear equations which are equivalent has infinitely many distinct common solutions. Such a pair is called a *dependent* pair of linear equations in two variables. Note that a dependent pair of linear equations is always consistent.\n\nWe can now summarise the behaviour of lines representing a pair of linear equations in two variables and the existence of solutions as follows:\n\n- (i) the lines may intersect in a single point. In this case, the pair of equations has a unique solution (consistent pair of equations).\n- (ii) the lines may be parallel. In this case, the equations have no solution (inconsistent pair of equations).\n- (iii) the lines may be coincident. In this case, the equations have infinitely many solutions [dependent (consistent) pair of equations].\n\nConsider the following three pairs of equations.\n\n- (i) *x* 2*y* = 0 and 3*x* + 4*y* 20 = 0 (The lines intersect)\n- (ii) 2*x* + 3*y* 9 = 0 and 4*x* + 6*y* 18 = 0 (The lines coincide)\n- (iii) *x* + 2*y* 4 = 0 and 2*x* + 4*y* 12 = 0 (The lines are parallel)\n\nLet us now write down, and compare, the values of 11 1 2 2 2 , and *ab c a b c* in all the\n\nthree examples. Here, *a*<sup>1</sup> , *b*<sup>1</sup> , *c*<sup>1</sup> and *a*<sup>2</sup> , *b*<sup>2</sup> , *c*<sup>2</sup> denote the coefficents of equations given in the general form in Section 3.2.\n\n| Table 3.1 |                                     |                  |                  |                   |                                                                    |                             |                                     |  |  |  |  |\n|-----------|-------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|--|--|--|--|\n| Sl<br>No. | Pair of lines                       | a<br>1<br>a<br>2 | b<br>1<br>b<br>2 | c<br>1<br>c<br>2  | Compare the<br>ratios                                              | Graphical<br>representation | Algebraic<br>interpretation         |  |  |  |  |\n| 1.        | x – 2y = 0<br>3x + 4y – 20 = 0      | 1<br>3           | −<br>2<br>4      | 0<br>−20          | a<br>b<br>≠<br>1<br>1<br>a<br>b<br>2<br>2                          | Intersecting<br>lines       | Exactly one<br>solution<br>(unique) |  |  |  |  |\n| 2.        | 2x + 3y – 9 = 0<br>4x + 6y – 18 = 0 | 2<br>4           | 3<br>6           | −<br>9<br>−<br>18 | a<br>b<br>c<br>=<br>=<br>1<br>1<br>1<br>a<br>b<br>c<br>2<br>2<br>2 | Coincident<br>lines         | Infinitely<br>many solutions        |  |  |  |  |\n| 3.        | x + 2y – 4 = 0<br>2x + 4y – 12 = 0  | 1<br>2           | 2<br>4           | −<br>4<br>−<br>12 | a<br>b<br>c<br>=<br>≠<br>1<br>1<br>1<br>a<br>b<br>c<br>2<br>2<br>2 | Parallel lines              | No solution                         |  |  |  |  |\n\nFrom the table above, you can observe that if the lines represented by the equation\n\n*a*1 *x* + *b*<sup>1</sup> *y* + *c*<sup>1</sup> = 0\n\nand *a*<sup>2</sup> *x* + *b*<sup>2</sup> *y* + *c* 2 = 0 *a b* ≠ ⋅\n\nare (i) intersecting, then 1 1\n\n(ii) coincident, then 1 1 1 2 2 2 *a b c a b c* = = ⋅ *a b c* = ≠ ⋅\n\n(iii) parallel, then 1 1 1 2 2 2 *a b c*\n\n2 2\n\n*a b*\n\nIn fact, the converse is also true for any pair of lines. You can verify them by considering some more examples by yourself.\n\nLet us now consider some more examples to illustrate it.\n\n**Example 1 :** Check graphically whether the pair of equations\n\n$$\nx + 3y = 6 \\tag{1}\n$$\n\nand 2*x* – 3*y* = 12 (2)\n\nis consistent. If so, solve them graphically.\n\n**Solution :** Let us draw the graphs of the Equations (1) and (2). For this, we find two solutions of each of the equations, which are given in Table 3.2\n\n| −<br>6<br>x<br>y =<br>3 | 2 | 0 | y = |\n|-------------------------|---|---|-----|\n\nPlot the points A(0, 2), B(6, 0), P(0, – 4) and Q(3, – 2) on graph paper, and join the points to form the lines AB and PQ as shown in Fig. 3.1.\n\nWe observe that there is a point B (6, 0) common to both the lines AB and PQ. So, the solution of the pair of linear equations is *x* = 6 and *y* = 0, i.e., the given pair of equations is consistent.\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_4.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_5.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_6.jpeg)\n\n**Example 2 :** Graphically, find whether the following pair of equations has no solution, unique solution or infinitely many solutions:\n\n$$\n5x - 8y + 1 = 0 \\tag{1}\n$$\n\n$$\n3x - \\frac{24}{5}y + \\frac{3}{5} = 0\n$$\n (2)\n\n**Solution :** Multiplying Equation (2) by 5 , 3 we get\n\n$$\n5x - 8y + 1 = 0\n$$\n\nBut, this is the same as Equation (1). Hence the lines represented by Equations (1) and (2) are coincident. Therefore, Equations (1) and (2) have infinitely many solutions.\n\nPlot few points on the graph and verify it yourself.\n\n**Example 3 :** Champa went to a 'Sale' to purchase some pants and skirts. When her friends asked her how many of each she had bought, she answered, \"The number of skirts is two less than twice the number of pants purchased. Also, the number of skirts is four less than four times the number of pants purchased\". Help her friends to find how many pants and skirts Champa bought.\n\n**Solution :** Let us denote the number of pants by *x* and the number of skirts by *y.* Then the equations formed are :\n\n$$\ny = 2x - 2 \\tag{1}\n$$\n\nand \n$$\ny = 4x - 4 \\tag{2}\n$$\n\nLet us draw the graphs of Equations (1) and (2) by finding two solutions for each of the equations. They are given in Table 3.3.\n\n![](_page_4_Figure_6.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_4_Figure_7.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_4_Figure_8.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_4_Figure_9.jpeg)\n\nPlot the points and draw the lines passing through them to represent the equations, as shown in Fig. 3.2.\n\nThe two lines intersect at the point (1, 0). So, *x* = 1, *y* = 0 is the required solution of the pair of linear equations, i.e., the number of pants she purchased is 1 and she did not buy any skirt.\n\n**Verify** the answer by checking whether it satisfies the conditions of the given problem.\n\n# **EXERCISE 3.1**\n\n- **1.** Form the pair of linear equations in the following problems, and find their solutions graphically.\n  - (i) 10 students of Class X took part in a Mathematics quiz.

Find the cost of one pencil and that of one pen.\n- **2.** On comparing the ratios 11 1 22 2 , and *ab c ab c* , find out whether the lines representing the\n\nfollowing pairs of linear equations intersect at a point, are parallel or coincident:\n\n- (i) 5*x* 4*y* + 8 = 0 (ii) 9*x* + 3*y* + 12 = 0 7*x* + 6*y* – 9 = 0 18*x* + 6*y* + 24 = 0\n- (iii) 6*x* 3*y* + 10 = 0 2*x* – *y* + 9 = 0\n- **3.** On comparing the ratios 1 1 2 2 , *a b a b* and <sup>1</sup> 2 *c <sup>c</sup>* , find out whether the following pair of linear\n\nequations are consistent, or inconsistent.\n\n- (i) 3*x* + 2*y* = 5 ; 2*x* 3*y* = 7 (ii) 2*x* 3*y* = 8 ; 4*x* 6*y* = 9 (iii) 3 5 <sup>7</sup> 2 3 *x y* ; 9*x* – 10*y* = 14 (iv) 5*x* – 3*y* = 11 ; – 10*x* + 6*y* = –22\n- (v) <sup>4</sup> 2 8 3 *x y* ;2*x* + 3*y* = 12\n- **4.** Which of the following pairs of linear equations are consistent/inconsistent? If consistent, obtain the solution graphically:\n  - (i) *x* + *y* = 5, 2*x* + 2*y* = 10\n  - (ii) *x y* = 8, 3*x* 3*y* = 16\n  - (iii) 2*x* + *y* 6 = 0, 4*x* 2*y* 4 = 0\n  - (iv) 2*x* 2*y* 2 = 0, 4*x* 4*y* 5 = 0\n- **5.** Half the perimeter of a rectangular garden, whose length is 4 m more than its width, is 36 m.

Determine the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle formed by these lines and the *x*-axis, and shade the triangular region.\n\n## **3.3 Algebraic Methods of Solving a Pair of Linear Equations**\n\nIn the previous section, we discussed how to solve a pair of linear equations graphically. The graphical method is not convenient in cases when the point representing the\n\nsolution of the linear equations has non-integral coordinates like ( 3, 2 7 ) ,\n\n(–1.75, 3.3), 4 1 , 13 19 , etc. There is every possibility of making mistakes while reading\n\nsuch coordinates. Is there any alternative method of finding the solution? There are several algebraic methods, which we shall now discuss.\n\n**3.3.1 Substitution Method :** We shall explain the method of substitution by taking some examples.\n\n**Example 4 :** Solve the following pair of equations by substitution method:\n\n$$\n7x - 15y = 2\n$$\n  \n  $x + 2y = 3$  (1)\n\n#### **Solution :**\n\n**Step 1 :** We pick either of the equations and write one variable in terms of the other. Let us consider the Equation (2) :\n\nand write it as *x* = 3 – 2*y* (3) **Step 2 :** Substitute the value of *x* in Equation (1). We get\n\n*x* + 2*y* = 3\n\n7(3 – 2*y*) – 15*y* = 2 i.e., 21 – 14*y* – 15*y* = 2 i.e., – 29*y* = –19 19\n\nTherefore, *y* = 29\n\n**Step 3 :** Substituting this value of *y* in Equation (3), we get\n\n$$\nx = 3 - 2\\left(\\frac{19}{29}\\right) = \\frac{49}{29}\n$$\n  \nTherefore, the solution is  $x = \\frac{49}{29}$ ,  $y = \\frac{19}{29}$ .\n\n**Verification :** Substituting *x* = 49 <sup>29</sup> and *y*<sup>=</sup> 19 <sup>29</sup> , you can verify that both the Equations\n\n(1) and (2) are satisfied.\n\nTo understand the substitution method more clearly, let us consider it stepwise:\n\n**Step 1 :** Find the value of one variable, say *y* in terms of the other variable, i.e., *x* from either equation, whichever is convenient.\n\n**Step 2 :** Substitute this value of *y* in the other equation, and reduce it to an equation in one variable, i.e., in terms of *x*, which can be solved. Sometimes, as in Examples 9 and 10 below, you can get statements with no variable. If this statement is true, you can conclude that the pair of linear equations has infinitely many solutions. If the statement is false, then the pair of linear equations is inconsistent.\n\n**Step 3 :** Substitute the value of *x* (or *y*) obtained in Step 2 in the equation used in Step 1 to obtain the value of the other variable.\n\n**Remark :** We have **substituted** the value of one variable by expressing it in terms of the other variable to solve the pair of linear equations. That is why the method is known as the *substitution method*.\n\n**Example 5 :** Solve the following question—Aftab tells his daughter, \"Seven years ago, I was seven times as old as you were then. Also, three years from now, I shall be three times as old as you will be.\" (Isn't this interesting?) Represent this situation algebraically and graphically by the method of substitution.\n\n**Solution :** Let *s* and *t* be the ages (in years) of Aftab and his daughter, respectively. Then, the pair of linear equations that represent the situation is\n\n$$\ns - 7 = 7(t - 7), \\text{ i.e., } s - 7t + 42 = 0 \\tag{1}\n$$\n\nand *s* + 3 = 3 (*t* + 3), i.e., *s* – 3*t* = 6 (2)\n\nUsing Equation (2), we get *s* = 3*t* + 6.\n\nPutting this value of *s* in Equation (1), we get\n\n$$\n(3t+6) - 7t + 42 = 0,\n$$\n\ni.e., \n$$\n4t = 48\n$$\n, which gives  $t = 12$ .\n\nPutting this value of *t* in Equation (2), we get\n\n$$\ns = 3(12) + 6 = 42\n$$\n\nSo, Aftab and his daughter are 42 and 12 years old, respectively.\n\nVerify this answer by checking if it satisfies the conditions of the given problems.\n\n**Example 6 :** In a shop the cost of 2 pencils and 3 erasers is `9 and the cost of 4 pencils and 6 erasers is `18. Find the cost of each pencil and each eraser.\n\n**Solution :** The pair of linear equations formed were:\n\n$$\n2x + 3y = 9\\tag{1}\n$$\n\n$$\n4x + 6y = 18\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nWe first express the value of *x* in terms of *y* from the equation 2*x* + 3*y* = 9, to get\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{9-3y}{2} \\tag{3}\n$$\n\nNow we substitute this value of *x* in Equation (2), to get\n\n$$\n\\frac{4(9-3y)}{2} + 6y = 18\n$$\n  \ni.e.,  \n18-6y+6y = 18  \ni.e.,  \n18 = 18\n\nThis statement is true for all values of *y*. However, we do not get a specific value of *y* as a solution. Therefore, we cannot obtain a specific value of *x*. This situation has arisen because both the given equations are the same. Therefore, Equations (1) and (2) have *infinitely many solutions.* We cannot find a unique cost of a pencil and an eraser, because there are many common solutions, to the given situation.\n\n**Example 7 :** Two rails are represented by the equations *x* + 2*y* – 4 = 0 and 2*x* + 4*y* – 12 = 0. Will the rails cross each other? **Solution :** The pair of linear equations formed were:\n\n$$\nx + 2y - 4 = 0 \\tag{1}\n$$\n\n$$\n2x + 4y - 12 = 0 \\tag{2}\n$$\n\nWe express *x* in terms of *y* from Equation (1) to get\n\n*x* = 4 – 2*y*\n\nNow, we substitute this value of *x* in Equation (2) to get\n\n$$\n2(4-2y) + 4y - 12 = 0\n$$\n\ni.e., 8 – 12 = 0 i.e., – 4 = 0\n\nwhich is a false statement.\n\nTherefore, the equations do not have a common solution. So, the two rails will not cross each other.\n\n#### **EXERCISE 3.2**\n\n- **1.** Solve the following pair of linear equations by the substitution method.\n  - (i) *x* + *y* = 14 (ii) *s t* = 3 *x* – *y* = 4 6 3 2 *s t* (iii) 3*x* – *y* = 3 (iv) 0.2*x* + 0.3*y* = 1.3 9*x* – 3*y* = 9 0.4*x* + 0.5*y* = 2.3 (v) 2 30 *x y* (vi) 3 5 <sup>2</sup> 2 3 *x y* 3 80 *x y* <sup>13</sup> 32 6 *x y*\n- **2.** Solve 2*x* + 3*y* = 11 and 2*x* 4*y* = 24 and hence find the value of '*m*' for which *y* = *mx* + 3.\n- **3.** Form the pair of linear equations for the following problems and find their solution by substitution method.\n  - (i) The difference between two numbers is 26 and one number is three times the other. Find them.\n  - (ii) The larger of two supplementary angles exceeds the smaller by 18 degrees. Find them.\n  - (iii) The coach of a cricket team buys 7 bats and 6 balls for ` 3800. Later, she buys 3 bats and 5 balls for ` 1750. Find the cost of each bat and each ball.\n  - (iv) The taxi charges in a city consist of a fixed charge together with the charge for the distance covered. For a distance of 10 km, the charge paid is ` 105 and for a journey of 15 km, the charge paid is ` 155. What are the fixed charges and the charge per km? How much does a person have to pay for travelling a distance of 25 km?\n  - (v) A fraction becomes <sup>9</sup> <sup>11</sup> , if 2 is added to both the numerator and the denominator. If, 3 is added to both the numerator and the denominator it becomes <sup>5</sup> 6 . Find the fraction.\n\n(vi) Five years hence, the age of Jacob will be three times that of his son. Five years ago, Jacob's age was seven times that of his son. What are their present ages?\n\n#### **3.3.2 Elimination Method**\n\nNow let us consider another method of eliminating (i.e., removing) one variable. This is sometimes more convenient than the substitution method. Let us see how this method works.\n\n**Example 8 :** The ratio of incomes of two persons is 9 : 7 and the ratio of their expenditures is 4 : 3. If each of them manages to save ` 2000 per month, find their monthly incomes.\n\n**Solution :** Let us denote the incomes of the two person by ` 9*x* and ` 7*x* and their expenditures by ` 4*y* and ` 3*y* respectively. Then the equations formed in the situation is given by :\n\n$$\n9x - 4y = 2000 \\tag{1}\n$$\n\nand \n$$\n7x - 3y = 2000\n$$\n (2)\n\n**Step 1 :** Multiply Equation (1) by 3 and Equation (2) by 4 to make the coefficients of *y* equal. Then we get the equations:\n\n$$\n27x - 12y = 6000 \\tag{3}\n$$\n\n$$\n28x - 12y = 8000 \\tag{4}\n$$\n\n**Step 2 :** Subtract Equation (3) from Equation (4) to *eliminate y*, because the coefficients of *y* are the same. So, we get\n\n$$\n(28x - 27x) - (12y - 12y) = 8000 - 6000\n$$\n  \ni.e., \n$$\nx = 2000\n$$\n\n**Step 3 :** Substituting this value of *x* in (1), we get\n\n$$\n9(2000) - 4y = 2000\n$$\n  \ni.e.,  $y = 4000$ \n\nSo, the solution of the equations is *x* = 2000, *y* = 4000. Therefore, the monthly incomes of the persons are ` 18,000 and ` 14,000, respectively.\n\n**Verification :** 18000 : 14000 = 9 : 7. Also, the ratio of their expenditures = 18000 – 2000 : 14000 – 2000 = 16000 : 12000 = 4 : 3\n\n#### **Remarks :**\n\n1. The method used in solving the example above is called the *elimination* method, because we eliminate one variable first, to get a linear equation in one variable. In the example above, we eliminated *y*. We could also have eliminated *x*. Try doing it that way.\n\n2. You could also have used the substitution, or graphical method, to solve this problem. Try doing so, and see which method is more convenient.\n\nLet us now note down these steps in the elimination method :\n\n**Step 1 :** First multiply both the equations by some suitable non-zero constants to make the coefficients of one variable (either *x* or *y*) numerically equal.\n\n**Step 2 :** Then add or subtract one equation from the other so that one variable gets eliminated. If you get an equation in one variable, go to Step 3.\n\nIf in Step 2, we obtain a true statement involving no variable, then the original pair of equations has infinitely many solutions.\n\nIf in Step 2, we obtain a false statement involving no variable, then the original pair of equations has no solution, i.e., it is inconsistent.\n\n**Step 3 :** Solve the equation in one variable (*x* or *y*) so obtained to get its value.\n\n**Step 4 :** Substitute this value of *x* (or *y*) in either of the original equations to get the value of the other variable.\n\nNow to illustrate it, we shall solve few more examples.\n\n**Example 9 :** Use elimination method to find all possible solutions of the following pair of linear equations :\n\n$$\n2x + 3y = 8 \\tag{1}\n$$\n\n$$\n4x + 6y = 7 \\tag{2}\n$$\n\n#### **Solution :**\n\n**Step 1 :** Multiply Equation (1) by 2 and Equation (2) by 1 to make the coefficients of *x* equal. Then we get the equations as :\n\n$$\n4x + 6y = 16 \\tag{3}\n$$\n\n$$\n4x + 6y = 7 \\tag{4}\n$$\n\n**Step 2 :** Subtracting Equation (4) from Equation (3),\n\n$$\n(4x - 4x) + (6y - 6y) = 16 - 7\n$$\n\ni.e., 0 = 9, which is a false statement.\n\nTherefore, the pair of equations has no solution.\n\n**Example 10 :** The sum of a two-digit number and the number obtained by reversing the digits is 66. If the digits of the number differ by 2, find the number. How many such numbers are there?\n\n**Solution :** Let the ten's and the unit's digits in the first number be *x* and *y*, respectively. So, the first number may be written as 10 *x* + *y* in the expanded form (for example, 56 = 10(5) + 6).\n\nWhen the digits are reversed, *x* becomes the unit's digit and *y* becomes the ten's digit.
