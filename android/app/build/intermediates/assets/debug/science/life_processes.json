These functions are called life processes. The maintenance of life requires processes like nutrition, respiration, transportation of materials within the body, and excretion of waste products. All these processes work together to ensure the survival of living organisms.</p><p>The life processes are essential for the maintenance of life. They include:</p><p>• Nutrition - obtaining and utilizing food<br>• Respiration - breaking down food to release energy<br>• Transportation - moving substances around the body<br>• Excretion - removing waste products</p><h2>4.1 What Are Life Processes?</h2><p>Life processes are the basic functions performed by living organisms to maintain their life. These processes are essential for survival and include nutrition, respiration, transportation, and excretion. All living organisms, from the smallest bacteria to the largest mammals, perform these life processes.</p><p>The maintenance of life requires the organism to keep repairing and maintaining its structures. Since all these structures are made up of molecules, they must be moved around all the time. Energy is needed to maintain the organization of molecules and this energy comes from outside the body of the organism.</p><h2>4.2 Nutrition</h2><p>Nutrition is the process by which organisms obtain and utilize food. Food provides energy and materials necessary for growth, repair, and maintenance of the body.</p><h3>4.2.1 Modes of Nutrition</h3><p>There are two main modes of nutrition:</p><p><strong>1. Autotrophic Nutrition:</strong><br>Organisms that can make their own food from simple inorganic substances are called autotrophs. They use carbon dioxide and water to synthesize carbohydrates in the presence of chlorophyll and sunlight. This process is called photosynthesis.</p><p>The equation for photosynthesis is:<br>6CO₂ + 6H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ (in the presence of chlorophyll and sunlight)</p><p><strong>2. Heterotrophic Nutrition:</strong><br>Organisms that cannot make their own food and depend on other organisms for food are called heterotrophs. This includes animals, fungi, and many bacteria.</p><p>Types of heterotrophic nutrition include:</p><p>• <strong>Saprotrophic:</strong> Organisms that feed on dead and decaying matter (e.g., fungi)<br>• <strong>Parasitic:</strong> Organisms that live on or inside other organisms and derive nutrition from them (e.g., tapeworm)<br>• <strong>Holozoic:</strong> Organisms that take in whole food and digest it internally (e.g., humans, animals)</p><h3>4.2.2 Nutrition in Human Beings</h3><p>Human beings exhibit holozoic nutrition. The human digestive system consists of the alimentary canal and associated glands.</p><p><strong>The Alimentary Canal includes:</strong></p><p>• <strong>Mouth:</strong> Food is ingested and mechanical digestion begins with chewing. Saliva contains amylase enzyme that breaks down starch.<br>• <strong>Oesophagus:</strong> A muscular tube that pushes food to the stomach through peristaltic movements.<br>• <strong>Stomach:</strong> A muscular bag where food is mixed with gastric juice containing pepsin enzyme and hydrochloric acid.<br>• <strong>Small Intestine:</strong> The longest part where complete digestion occurs. It has three parts - duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.<br>• <strong>Large Intestine:</strong> Water absorption occurs here, and undigested food is formed into faeces.</p><p><strong>Associated Glands:</strong></p><p>• <strong>Salivary Glands:</strong> Secrete saliva containing amylase<br>• <strong>Liver:</strong> Produces bile juice that emulsifies fats<br>• <strong>Pancreas:</strong> Secretes pancreatic juice containing various digestive enzymes</p><h3>4.2.3 Nutrition in Plants</h3><p>Plants are autotrophic and prepare their food through photosynthesis. This process occurs mainly in leaves, which contain chloroplasts with chlorophyll.</p><p><strong>Requirements for Photosynthesis:</strong></p><p>• Sunlight (source of energy)<br>• Carbon dioxide (from atmosphere through stomata)<br>• Water (absorbed by roots from soil)<br>• Chlorophyll (present in chloroplasts)</p><p><strong>Products of Photosynthesis:</strong></p><p>• Glucose (stored as starch)<br>• Oxygen (released into atmosphere)</p><h2>4.3 Respiration</h2><p>Respiration is the process by which organisms break down food molecules to release energy for cellular activities. It involves the breakdown of glucose to release energy in the form of ATP.</p><h3>4.3.1 Types of Respiration</h3><p><strong>1. Aerobic Respiration:</strong><br>This occurs in the presence of oxygen. Glucose is completely broken down into carbon dioxide and water, releasing maximum energy.</p><p>C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Energy (38 ATP molecules)</p><p><strong>2. Anaerobic Respiration:</strong><br>This occurs in the absence of oxygen. Glucose is incompletely broken down, releasing less energy.</p><p>In muscles during vigorous exercise:<br>C₆H₁₂O₆ → 2C₃H₆O₃ + Energy (2 ATP molecules)</p><p>In yeast:<br>C₆H₁₂O₆ → 2C₂H₅OH + 2CO₂ + Energy (2 ATP molecules)</p><h3>4.3.2 Respiration in Human Beings</h3><p>The human respiratory system consists of nostrils, nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli in the lungs.</p><p><strong>Mechanism of Breathing:</strong></p><p>• <strong>Inspiration:</strong> Diaphragm moves down, ribcage moves up and outward, creating space for air to enter the lungs<br>• <strong>Expiration:</strong> Diaphragm moves up, ribcage moves down and inward, pushing air out of the lungs</p><p><strong>Exchange of Gases:</strong><br>Oxygen from alveolar air diffuses into blood, while carbon dioxide from blood diffuses into alveolar air. This exchange occurs due to concentration gradients.</p><h3>4.3.3 Respiration in Plants</h3><p>Plants also respire continuously, both during day and night. During photosynthesis in the day, the oxygen released is more than what is used in respiration. At night, plants only respire and take in oxygen while giving out carbon dioxide.</p><p>Gas exchange in plants occurs through:</p><p>• <strong>Stomata:</strong> In leaves<br>• <strong>Lenticels:</strong> In stems<br>• <strong>Root surface:</strong> In roots</p><h2>4.4 Transportation</h2><p>Transportation is the process by which substances like food, oxygen, water, and waste products are carried from one part of the body to another.</p><h3>4.4.1 Transportation in Human Beings</h3><p>The circulatory system in humans consists of the heart, blood vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries), and blood.</p><p><strong>The Human Heart:</strong><br>It is a four-chambered muscular organ with two atria (upper chambers) and two ventricles (lower chambers). The heart pumps oxygenated blood to all parts of the body and receives deoxygenated blood back.</p><p><strong>Blood Vessels:</strong></p><p>• <strong>Arteries:</strong> Carry oxygenated blood away from the heart (except pulmonary artery)<br>• <strong>Veins:</strong> Carry deoxygenated blood toward the heart (except pulmonary vein)<br>• <strong>Capillaries:</strong> Tiny vessels where exchange of materials occurs</p><p><strong>Components of Blood:</strong></p><p>• <strong>Plasma:</strong> Liquid component containing water, proteins, glucose, and other substances<br>• <strong>Red Blood Cells (RBC):</strong> Contain haemoglobin and transport oxygen<br>• <strong>White Blood Cells (WBC):</strong> Fight infections and provide immunity<br>• <strong>Platelets:</strong> Help in blood clotting</p><h3>4.4.2 Transportation in Plants</h3><p>Plants have two types of transport systems:</p><p><strong>1. Xylem:</strong><br>Transports water and minerals from roots to leaves. The movement is unidirectional (upward) and occurs due to transpiration pull, root pressure, and capillary action.</p><p><strong>2. Phloem:</strong><br>Transports food (mainly sucrose) from leaves to other parts of the plant. The movement is bidirectional and occurs through translocation.</p><p><strong>Transpiration:</strong><br>It is the loss of water from plant surfaces, mainly through stomata in leaves. It helps in:</p><p>• Cooling the plant<br>• Creating transpiration pull for water transport<br>• Maintaining water balance</p><h2>4.5 Excretion</h2><p>Excretion is the process by which waste products of metabolism are removed from the body. These waste products, if accumulated, can be harmful to the organism.</p><h3>4.5.1 Excretion in Human Beings</h3><p>The human excretory system consists of kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra.</p><p><strong>The Kidneys:</strong><br>Two bean-shaped organs that filter blood to remove waste products and excess water. Each kidney contains millions of functional units called nephrons.</p><p><strong>Structure of Nephron:</strong></p><p>• <strong>Glomerulus:</strong> Cluster of capillaries where filtration occurs<br>• <strong>Bowman's Capsule:</strong> Cup-shaped structure surrounding glomerulus<br>• <strong>Tubule:</strong> Long coiled tube where reabsorption and secretion occur</p><p><strong>Process of Urine Formation:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>Filtration:</strong> Blood is filtered in glomerulus, forming glomerular filtrate<br>2. <strong>Reabsorption:</strong> Useful substances like glucose, amino acids, and water are reabsorbed<br>3. <strong>Secretion:</strong> Additional waste products are secreted into urine</p><h3>4.5.2 Excretion in Plants</h3><p>Plants produce less toxic waste compared to animals. They excrete waste through:</p><p>• <strong>Transpiration:</strong> Excess water and some waste products<br>• <strong>Diffusion:</strong> Gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide<br>• <strong>Storage:</strong> Some waste products are stored in leaves, bark, and fruits</p><p>Many plant waste products are actually useful, such as:</p><p>• Oxygen (from photosynthesis)<br>• Resins, gums, and latex<br>• Essential oils</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Life processes are fundamental to the survival of all living organisms. Nutrition provides energy and building materials, respiration releases energy from food, transportation ensures distribution of materials, and excretion removes harmful waste products. These processes work in coordination to maintain life and ensure the proper functioning of living organisms.</p><p>Understanding these life processes helps us appreciate the complexity and efficiency of living systems, from the smallest cellular activities to the coordinated functioning of organ systems in complex organisms like humans.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Respiration in human beings involves breathing (ventilation) and cellular respiration. The process includes the following steps:</p><p><strong>Pathway of Air:</strong><br>Air enters through nostrils → nasal cavity → pharynx → larynx → trachea → bronchi → bronchioles → alveoli in lungs</p><p><strong>Mechanism of Breathing:</strong><br>1. <strong>Inspiration (Inhalation):</strong> The diaphragm contracts and moves downward, while the ribcage moves upward and outward.

This decreases the chest cavity volume, creating higher pressure that pushes air out of the lungs.</p><p><strong>Gas Exchange:</strong><br>Gas exchange occurs in the alveoli through diffusion. Oxygen from the alveolar air dissolves in the moisture lining the alveoli and diffuses into the blood capillaries. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide from the blood diffuses into the alveolar air to be expelled during expiration. This exchange is possible due to the concentration gradient and the thin walls of alveoli and capillaries.</p>"
