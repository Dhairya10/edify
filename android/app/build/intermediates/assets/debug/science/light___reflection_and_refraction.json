It travels in straight lines and exhibits several interesting phenomena when it interacts with different surfaces and media. Two of the most important phenomena associated with light are reflection and refraction. These phenomena explain how we see images in mirrors, how lenses work, and why objects appear bent when placed in water.</p><p>In this chapter, we will study the behavior of light when it falls on polished surfaces like mirrors and when it travels from one transparent medium to another. We will also learn about the formation of images by spherical mirrors and lenses, and their practical applications in our daily life.</p><h2>10.1 Reflection of Light</h2><p>When light falls on a surface, it bounces back. This phenomenon is called reflection of light. The surface from which light bounces back is called a reflecting surface.</p><h3>10.1.1 Laws of Reflection</h3><p>The reflection of light follows two fundamental laws:</p><p><strong>First Law:</strong> The incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal to the surface at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane.</p><p><strong>Second Law:</strong> The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.</p><p>Where:<br>• Incident ray: The ray of light that falls on the reflecting surface<br>• Reflected ray: The ray of light that bounces back from the reflecting surface<br>• Normal: A line perpendicular to the reflecting surface at the point of incidence<br>• Angle of incidence (i): The angle between the incident ray and the normal<br>• Angle of reflection (r): The angle between the reflected ray and the normal</p><h3>10.1.2 Types of Reflection</h3><p><strong>Regular Reflection:</strong> When parallel rays of light fall on a smooth surface, they are reflected as parallel rays. This type of reflection occurs from polished surfaces like mirrors.</p><p><strong>Irregular or Diffuse Reflection:</strong> When parallel rays of light fall on a rough surface, they are reflected in different directions. This type of reflection occurs from rough surfaces like walls, paper, etc.</p><h2>10.2 Spherical Mirrors</h2><p>A spherical mirror is a part of a hollow sphere whose one surface is polished and acts as a reflecting surface.</p><h3>10.2.1 Types of Spherical Mirrors</h3><p><strong>Concave Mirror:</strong> A spherical mirror whose reflecting surface is curved inward is called a concave mirror. It is also called a converging mirror.</p><p><strong>Convex Mirror:</strong> A spherical mirror whose reflecting surface is curved outward is called a convex mirror. It is also called a diverging mirror.</p><h3>10.2.2 Important Terms Related to Spherical Mirrors</h3><p>• <strong>Centre of Curvature (C):</strong> The centre of the sphere of which the mirror is a part<br>• <strong>Radius of Curvature (R):</strong> The radius of the sphere of which the mirror is a part<br>• <strong>Pole (P):</strong> The centre of the reflecting surface of the mirror<br>• <strong>Principal Axis:</strong> The straight line passing through the pole and centre of curvature<br>• <strong>Principal Focus (F):</strong> The point on the principal axis where parallel rays converge after reflection (concave) or appear to diverge from (convex)<br>• <strong>Focal Length (f):</strong> The distance between the pole and the principal focus. f = R/2</p><h3>10.2.3 Image Formation by Spherical Mirrors</h3><p><strong>For Concave Mirrors:</strong></p><p>1. Object at infinity: Image formed at focus, highly diminished, real and inverted<br>2. Object beyond C: Image between F and C, diminished, real and inverted<br>3. Object at C: Image at C, same size, real and inverted<br>4. Object between C and F: Image beyond C, enlarged, real and inverted<br>5. Object at F: Image at infinity, highly enlarged, real and inverted<br>6. Object between F and P: Image behind mirror, enlarged, virtual and erect</p><p><strong>For Convex Mirrors:</strong></p><p>Convex mirrors always form virtual, erect, and diminished images regardless of the object position.</p><h3>10.2.4 Mirror Formula and Magnification</h3><p><strong>Mirror Formula:</strong> 1/f = 1/v + 1/u</p><p>Where:<br>• f = focal length of the mirror<br>• v = image distance<br>• u = object distance</p><p><strong>Magnification (m):</strong> m = -v/u = height of image/height of object</p><p>Sign Convention:<br>• All distances are measured from the pole of the mirror<br>• Distances measured in the direction of incident light are positive<br>• Distances measured opposite to the direction of incident light are negative</p><h2>10.3 Refraction of Light</h2><p>When light travels from one transparent medium to another, it bends at the boundary between the two media. This phenomenon is called refraction of light.</p><h3>10.3.1 Laws of Refraction</h3><p><strong>First Law:</strong> The incident ray, the refracted ray, and the normal to the interface at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane.</p><p><strong>Second Law (Snell's Law):</strong> The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of refraction is constant for a given pair of media.</p><p>sin i/sin r = constant = n (refractive index)</p><h3>10.3.2 Refractive Index</h3><p>The refractive index of a medium is defined as the ratio of speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in that medium.</p><p>n = c/v</p><p>Where:<br>• n = refractive index<br>• c = speed of light in vacuum (3 × 10⁸ m/s)<br>• v = speed of light in the medium</p><h2>10.4 Spherical Lenses</h2><p>A lens is a piece of transparent glass or plastic bound by two surfaces, at least one of which is curved.</p><h3>10.4.1 Types of Lenses</h3><p><strong>Convex Lens (Converging Lens):</strong> A lens that is thicker at the center and thinner at the edges. It converges parallel rays of light.</p><p><strong>Concave Lens (Diverging Lens):</strong> A lens that is thinner at the center and thicker at the edges. It diverges parallel rays of light.</p><h3>10.4.2 Image Formation by Lenses</h3><p><strong>For Convex Lens:</strong></p><p>1. Object at infinity: Image at F₂, highly diminished, real and inverted<br>2. Object beyond 2F₁: Image between F₂ and 2F₂, diminished, real and inverted<br>3. Object at 2F₁: Image at 2F₂, same size, real and inverted<br>4. Object between 2F₁ and F₁: Image beyond 2F₂, enlarged, real and inverted<br>5. Object at F₁: Image at infinity, highly enlarged, real and inverted<br>6. Object between F₁ and optical center: Image on same side, enlarged, virtual and erect</p><p><strong>For Concave Lens:</strong></p><p>Concave lenses always form virtual, erect, and diminished images regardless of object position.</p><h3>10.4.3 Lens Formula and Magnification</h3><p><strong>Lens Formula:</strong> 1/f = 1/v - 1/u</p><p><strong>Power of Lens:</strong> P = 1/f (in meters)</p><p>Unit of power is dioptre (D).</p><h2>10.5 Applications</h2><p><strong>Concave Mirrors:</strong> Used in torches, headlights, shaving mirrors, solar cookers, and reflecting telescopes.</p><p><strong>Convex Mirrors:</strong> Used as rear-view mirrors in vehicles and as security mirrors in shops.</p><p><strong>Convex Lenses:</strong> Used in magnifying glasses, cameras, microscopes, and telescopes. Also used to correct hypermetropia.</p><p><strong>Concave Lenses:</strong> Used to correct myopia and in combination with convex lenses in optical instruments.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>Convex mirrors are preferred as rear-view mirrors in vehicles for the following reasons:</p><p>1. <strong>Wider field of view:</strong> Convex mirrors provide a much wider field of view compared to plane mirrors, allowing drivers to see more area behind the vehicle.</p><p>2. <strong>Always erect images:</strong> They always form erect images, making it easier for drivers to interpret the view.</p><p>3. <strong>Diminished images:</strong> Though the images are smaller, this allows more area to be covered in the same mirror size.</p><p>4. <strong>Virtual images:</strong> The virtual images formed help in judging the relative positions of vehicles behind.</p><p>These features make convex mirrors much safer for driving as they reduce blind spots significantly.</p>"
